# been written rather than captured. Every one of them was a claim nobody had
# executed. This executes them.
#
# It does NOT cover steps 4/5/7 (container) — no runtime here, which is the

# The `wring` under test. SETUP.md step 3 installs it with `uv tool install`,
# which puts it in ~/.local/bin — so that is where to look first. The repo's
# .venv stays as a fallback for a developer working from a checkout.
#
# The old line prepended ONLY the venv, which the rewritten step 3 no longer
# creates. The prepend was a silent no-op and the script tested whatever
# `wring` happened to be on PATH, which might be an old release, or nothing
# at all (R2-06). Testing the wrong binary and testing no binary look
# identical in a passing log, so this now says which one it found and stops
# if there is none.
# The repo's own venv FIRST, then the uv-tool install SETUP.md creates.
#
# This was the other way round, and it produced a false green: a developer
# with a stale `wring` in ~/.local/bin ran this from the repo and tested that
# binary rather than the source they had just edited, so the script passed
# locally while CI — which has no global install — failed on both platforms.
# A fresh user following SETUP.md has no .venv, so they still exercise the
# installed tool, which is what this script is for. The line below prints
# which one won, and that line is the receipt.
