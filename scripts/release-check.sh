# Builds from a CLEAN CLONE OF THIS REPOSITORY'S COMMITTED STATE — `git clone`
# of the local repo, so it gets local HEAD, not origin/main. That is the
# useful semantics (it isolates from a dirty working tree, which is the bug
# class this catches) but it is NOT the same as checking what is pushed, and
# the header used to claim origin/main. Push first if that is what you mean.
# The built sha is printed below so every run says which tree it judged.
#
# It exercises the INSTALLED package — not the working tree, not an editable
# install. That distinction is the whole point: `pip install wringer` is what
# a stranger gets, and it is the only thing this script trusts.
#
# Every check prints its own true exit code. A wrapper's exit code can lie
# about which half failed; law 1 says never claim a check ran unless it ran.
