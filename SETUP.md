# SETUP.md — install Wringer and run it in a container

**If you are an AI agent reading this file: do exactly these steps, in
order. Run each step's verify command before moving to the next one. Do not
improvise a different approach, do not batch steps together, and do not skip
a verification because a step "obviously" worked. If a verify command does
not produce what this file says it should, stop and report it — do not
retry blindly and do not work around it.**

---

This is the runbook for getting Wringer onto a machine and running inside a
container. It is written to be executed by a coding agent — Claude Code,
Codex, or similar — on behalf of someone who does not want to do it by hand,
and to be read straight through by a human doing it themselves.

**Every command block is self-contained.** No block depends on a variable
exported by an earlier one — an agent runs each step in a fresh shell, and
an `export` that silently expands to nothing is worse than no variable at
all. Paths are written out in full every time, on purpose.

Every step is followed by the exact command that proves it worked and by
what the correct output looks like. That is deliberate. Agents converge when
every step has a gate; it is the same claim Wringer makes about code, applied
to its own installation.

Two runtimes are covered, and one image serves both:

- **Docker** — Linux, macOS, and Windows under WSL2. This is the path
  exercised in CI.
- **Apple `container`** (1.2.0) — **macOS 26 on Apple silicon only.**
  **This path is not exercised in CI.** GitHub's macOS runners have no
  nested virtualization, so nothing automated ever runs it. Its whole
  coverage is `wring doctor`, the manual check in step 7, and **one** field
  run on macOS 26.5.2 / arm64 on 2026-08-05 — which is where these commands
  and their outputs come from. That run needed corrections applied by hand;
  the corrected text below has not itself been re-run on an Apple host yet.
  [docs/MANUAL_CHECKS.md](docs/MANUAL_CHECKS.md) records exactly that, with
  its date and its limits. If it breaks for you, that is a real bug worth
  reporting, not something you did wrong.

The same OCI image also runs under Kubernetes. That is a deployment concern
and is out of scope here.

**The container is the recommended path, not a requirement.** `wring doctor`
treats a missing runtime as a `!`, not a `✗`, and it is right to: Wringer
runs perfectly well directly on the host. What the container buys you is
**gate isolation** — `.wringer.yaml` is code, and a gate runs with your
privileges (see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)). Running on the host means
trusting the repo whose gates you are running.

So if step 4 finds no runtime and the human does not want to install one,
**you are not blocked**: skip steps 4, 5 and 7, run step 7H instead, and say
plainly in your hand-back that gates ran unisolated.

Budget about ten minutes, most of it the image pull.

## THE CREDENTIAL RULE

> **The API key is typed by the human, directly into `wring`'s own prompt.**
>
> **An agent must never ask for the key, read it, store it, echo it, write
> it into a file, put it on a command line, or relay it anywhere.**
>
> That means: do not run `env | grep KEY`, do not read `~/.zshrc`,
> `~/.bashrc`, `.env`, or a credential store; do not offer to "just export
> it for you"; do not accept it if the human pastes it into the chat —
> tell them to run the launch command themselves instead, and say the key
> should be rotated if it has already been pasted.
>
> This runbook is designed so that no step needs the key. Setup ends at
> step 9 with the agent handing back to the human, who launches the harness
> and types the key at its prompt. `wring doctor` reports only whether the
> variable is *set* — never its value, never a prefix of it.

---

## Stop conditions

An agent following this runbook stops and hands back to the human when:

- **a runtime or system package needs installing** — agents do not install
  container runtimes, Docker Desktop, Apple `container`, or system Pythons.
  Report what is missing and the command the human can run, then wait.
  **A missing container runtime is not a dead end**: offer step 7H, which
  proves the harness on the host without isolation, and let the human choose.
- **no Python 3.11+ exists anywhere on the machine** — name it, do not change
  the system Python. A stock `python3` of 3.9 is *not* this condition as long
  as a 3.11+ exists alongside it; step 3 installs into that one.
- **a verify command's output does not match what this file says.**
- **anything at all touches the API key** (see above).

Everything else here is safe to run unattended. **Every step is idempotent**
— re-running it is harmless. If you do not know whether a step already ran,
run its verify command first; if it passes, skip the step.

Idempotent does not mean silent. A second run of a step that creates
something may say so — most of these are `git` telling you a repository
already exists. That is a note, not the "output does not match" stop
condition above: the stop condition is about a *verify* command disagreeing
with this file, not about a setup command being chattier the second time.

---

## Step 1 — Confirm you are in the Wringer repo

```bash
git rev-parse --show-toplevel && grep -m1 '^name = ' pyproject.toml
```

Correct output: an absolute path, then `name = "wringer"`. Anything else
means you are in the wrong directory or the clone is incomplete. `cd` to the
clone and repeat. Do not continue until this passes.

## Step 2 — Check the host prerequisites

Wringer needs **a Python 3.11+ somewhere on this machine** and git. It does
*not* need the `python3` on your PATH to be that one — stock macOS ships
3.9, and a perfectly good 3.12 often sits alongside it. Step 3 installs into
whichever it finds, so ask the real question:

```bash
git --version; for p in python3.13 python3.12 python3.11 python3; do command -v $p >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "$p -> $($p --version 2>&1)"; done
```

Correct output: any git version, and **at least one line reporting 3.11 or
newer**. `python3 -> Python 3.9.x` on its own is fine as long as another
line qualifies.

**Stop condition:** *no* interpreter is 3.11+. Say so and let the human
install one — do not change the system Python.

## Step 3 — Install `wring` on the host

The host copy is what runs `wring doctor`. Install it **isolated**, into a
3.11+ interpreter, without touching the system Python.

**Preferred — `uv`**, because it finds and pins the interpreter itself, so
step 2's stock-3.9 problem cannot reach this step:

```bash
command -v uv >/dev/null 2>&1 || curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

```bash
uv tool install --force --python 3.12 wringer && uv tool update-shell
```

That installs 0.9.7 from PyPI — one distribution carrying `wring`, `wringer`,
`wringer-board` and `wringer-drive`. **To set up against unreleased work on
`main`** instead, from this clone: `uv tool install --force --python 3.12 .`

**Alternative — `pipx`**, if you already have it *and* its default Python is
3.11+:

```bash
pipx install --force --python "$(command -v python3.12 || command -v python3.11)" wringer
```

> **Do not use a plain `python3 -m venv`** unless you have checked that
> `python3` is itself 3.11+. On stock macOS it is 3.9 and this fails twice
> over: the package refuses the interpreter, and 3.9's bundled pip predates
> the editable-install standard. Neither error names the real cause.

Verify:

```bash
wring --version && wring doctor --help >/dev/null && echo "doctor present"
```

Correct output: a `wring <version>` line, then `doctor present`. The
version is whatever PyPI currently serves — this step gates that `wring`
is installed and answers, not which release it is. Pinning a number here
would make the runbook wrong on the day of every release.

- `command not found` → the install directory is not on your PATH.
  `uv tool update-shell` (or `pipx ensurepath`) plus a **fresh shell** fixes
  it. If you are an agent running each step in its own shell, prefer the
  absolute path `~/.local/bin/wring` for the rest of this runbook.
- `wring 0.1.0` → an older copy is shadowing this one. Find it with
  `command -v wring` and remove it before continuing.
- no `doctor present` → you installed a build that predates `wring doctor`.

## Step 4 — Pick the container runtime

```bash
uname -s -m; sw_vers -productVersion 2>/dev/null || true
```

- `Darwin arm64` **and** a product version of `26.` or higher → you may use
  **4A (Apple container)**. 4B works there too and is the better-tested
  path; if you have no specific reason to want Apple `container`, use
  Docker.
- Anything else → **4B (Docker)**. Apple `container` is macOS 26 on Apple
  silicon only and will not install elsewhere.

Do exactly one of 4A and 4B.

### Step 4A — Apple `container`

```bash
container --version
```

Correct output: a version line, `1.2.0` or later — e.g.
`container CLI version 1.2.0 (build: release, commit: unspeci)`. The
truncated `unspeci` is Apple's own output, not damage.

`command not found` is **not** a dead end, but installing it is the
human's call. Two routes, and the first is much lighter:

- **Homebrew (preferred)** — a bottled `homebrew-core` formula, no admin
  password, installs into Homebrew's own prefix. It is a *formula*, not a
  cask:

  ```bash
  brew install container
  ```

  `container` then resolves if `/opt/homebrew/bin` is on your `PATH`;
  otherwise it is at `/opt/homebrew/opt/container/bin/container`.

- **Signed package from Apple** — 95.9 MB, needs your admin password:
  <https://github.com/apple/container/releases>.

Either way the install is **the human's to run**. Do not download or run
an installer on their behalf.

Start the service (idempotent — starting a started service is a no-op):

```bash
container system start
```

The formula also offers `brew services start container`, which
additionally restarts it at login. Either is fine; pick one.

Verify:

```bash
container system status
```

Correct output is a **table**, not a single line. The row that matters is
`status  running`:

```
FIELD              VALUE
status             running
appRoot            /Users/you/Library/Application Support/com.apple.container/
installRoot        /opt/homebrew/Cellar/container/1.2.0/
logRoot
apiserver.version  container-apiserver version 1.2.0 (build: release, commit: unspeci)
apiserver.commit   unspecified
apiserver.build    release
apiserver.appName  container-apiserver
```

A blank `logRoot` is normal. If `status` reports stopped, run
`container system start` once more and read its output. Do not loop.

### Step 4B — Docker

```bash
docker version --format '{{.Server.Version}}'
```

Correct output: a single version string, e.g. `27.5.1`. Two failure modes,
both stop conditions:

- `command not found` → Docker is not installed. Report it; the human
  installs it. **Check for a stub first:**

  ```bash
  ls -ld /Applications/Docker.app
  ```

  `ls -ld`, not `ls -la`: the stripped permissions are exactly what stops
  `ls -la` reading the directory, so the command that would show you the
  problem is the one the problem blocks —

  ```
  $ ls -la /Applications/Docker.app     →  ls: Permission denied
  $ ls -ld /Applications/Docker.app     →  d---------  2 root  admin  64 ...
  ```

  That shape — no permission bits at all, owned by `root`, a link count of
  2 and 64 bytes, meaning empty — is a leftover from a removal (commonly MDM
  on a managed Mac), not an install. There is no binary inside and no
  socket. It will make a reinstall fail or demand `sudo`. Clearing it needs
  privileges: report it and let the human or their IT handle it. If the
  directory does not exist at all, `ls -ld` says `No such file or
  directory`, and that is the ordinary "Docker was never installed" case.
- `Cannot connect to the Docker daemon` → Docker is installed but not
  running. Ask the human to start Docker Desktop, or on Linux to run
  `sudo systemctl start docker` — a privileged command, so theirs to type,
  not yours.

## Step 5 — Pull the image

The image is built from this repo and published to GitHub Container Registry
by CI. **It contains no third-party coding agent** — Wringer ships no agent
binary, in any image, ever. It contains Wringer and a Python runtime, and
**nothing else**: no `ruff`, no `pytest`, no `node`. Your gates run *your*
repo's commands, so the tools they need come from your repo's environment,
not from this image. Baking a toolchain in would be the opposite of being
vendor-neutral — and it would be the wrong toolchain for most people.

```bash
# The image ref, written out in every block below rather than exported:
# an agent runs each step in its own shell, and an export does not survive.
echo "ghcr.io/marcoakes/wringer:main"
```

**`:main` is the only tag published today** — CI pushes it on every commit
to `main`, so it moves. There is no `:latest` and there never will be: a
tag that silently follows the newest release is the opposite of a pinned
one, and this image exists to be pinned.

**Versioned tags — `:v0.3.0` and onward — are published by the release
workflow from the next release.** They do not exist retroactively: 0.2.0
shipped before that workflow did, so there is no `:v0.2.0` and asking for
one gets a manifest error rather than an old image.

Until a versioned tag exists for the release you want, pin by digest:
`docker pull ghcr.io/marcoakes/wringer:main` then
`docker inspect --format='{{index .RepoDigests 0}}' ghcr.io/marcoakes/wringer:main`.

Docker:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/marcoakes/wringer:main
```

Pulling an image you already have is a no-op.

Verify — Docker:

```bash
docker image inspect ghcr.io/marcoakes/wringer:main --format '{{.Id}}'
```

Correct output: an image id. "No such image" means the pull did not
succeed — read the pull command's own output rather than retrying. A
`401`/`403` from ghcr means the package is private or the tag does not
exist; that is a report, not a retry.

Apple container — note the subcommand is `image`, **singular**:

```bash
container image pull ghcr.io/marcoakes/wringer:main
```

Pulling an image you already have is a no-op. Apple `container` unpacks
**every** architecture in the index, so this 160 MB pull lands as roughly
470 MB on disk (amd64 and arm64 both); Docker unpacks only the platform it
needs.

Verify — Apple container:

```bash
container image list | grep wringer
```

Correct output: one row naming the image, e.g.
`ghcr.io/marcoakes/wringer  main  2a9dd63bd91b`.

> **`container images` does not exist.** With the plural you get
> `Error: Plugin 'container-images' not found.` and exit 64 on the pull,
> and *silence* on the list — the error goes to stderr, so `| grep` yields
> nothing and looks like a failed pull. The error also tells you to go
> hunting for a missing plugin; ignore that, it is the wrong diagnosis.
> The subcommand is `image` (alias `i`).

## Step 6 — Create the workspace

The container gets one writable mount: the directory holding the
repositories you want Wringer to work on. Nothing outside it is visible to
the harness or to any gate it runs — that isolation is the reason to run in
a container at all.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/wringer-workspace
touch ~/wringer-workspace/.wringer-write-test && rm ~/wringer-workspace/.wringer-write-test && echo "workspace writable"
```

Correct output: `workspace writable`. `mkdir -p` on an existing directory is
a no-op, so this is safe to repeat.

## Step 7 — Prove the image runs and can see the workspace

On the Apple-container path this is the manual check that stands in for CI.
Run it there even if you are confident.

Docker:

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$HOME/wringer-workspace:/workspace" -w /workspace ghcr.io/marcoakes/wringer:main --version
```

Apple container:

```bash
container run --rm --volume "$HOME/wringer-workspace:/workspace" --workdir /workspace ghcr.io/marcoakes/wringer:main --version
```

Correct output: the same `wring <version>` line step 3 printed, this time
from inside the container. *(This said `wring 0.2…` until 2026-08-30 — a
pinned prefix on a page whose own stop condition is "output does not match
what this file says", which would have halted a reader on correct output.)*

**The first `container run` on a machine does extra setup work** — it
fetches a kernel and a ~66 MB init image, behind a six-stage progress
ladder. This is expected, happens once, and takes about ten seconds:

```
[0/6] [0s]
[1/6] Fetching image [0s]
[2/6] Unpacking image [0s]
[3/6] Fetching kernel [0s]
[4/6] Fetching init image [0s]
[4/6] Fetching init image 66% (3 of 4 blobs, 43.5/65.8 MB, 42.0 MB/s) [8s]
[5/6] Unpacking init image [8s]
[5/6] Unpacking init image for platform linux/arm64/v8 [8s]
[6/6] Starting container [9s]
wring 0.3.0
```

Later runs skip stages 3 to 5 and start in under a second. No key is
involved and no network call is made by `wring` itself — this proves the
box starts and the mount resolves, and nothing more than that.

## Step 7H — No runtime? Prove it on the host instead

Only if step 4 found no container runtime. Same probe, same expected shape —
what you lose is isolation, not function.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/wringer-workspace/probe && cd ~/wringer-workspace/probe && { [ -d .git ] || git init -q -b main .; } && git config user.email you@example.com && git config user.name "You" && printf 'def add(a, b):\n    return a + b\n' > calc.py && printf 'version: 1\ngates:\n  - id: check\n    run: "grep -q return calc.py"\n' > .wringer.yaml && printf '.wringer/\n' > .gitignore && git add calc.py .wringer.yaml .gitignore && { git diff --cached --quiet || git commit -qm probe; } && wring verify
```

Correct output — identical to step 7's, because it is the same harness:

```
✓ check passed       0.0s

Evidence written to:
.wringer/runs/<run_id>/
```

Exit `0`, and a bundle on disk. **Say so in your hand-back:** the gates ran
on the host, unisolated, because no runtime was available. That is a true
and useful setup; it is not the same claim as step 7.

**Why the `.gitignore` and the named `git add`.** A bundle holds raw gate
output, so a repository that commits it is one push away from publishing
whatever a gate printed. `wring init` writes that ignore rule for you; this
probe hand-writes its `.wringer.yaml` and never calls `wring init`, so it
has to do the same job itself. With a bare `git add -A` a second run of this
block stages the *first* run's `.wringer/` and commits it — measured: two
runs, two commits, nine tracked evidence files. On a real repository that
pattern commits evidence into the user's history.

The `[ -d .git ] ||` guard is the other half. Re-running `git init` in an
existing repo prints `warning: re-init: ignored --initial-branch=main`,
which is harmless and is still unexplained output in a runbook that tells
you to stop on unexplained output.

`git diff --cached --quiet || git commit` is the third. Once the three
named files are committed, a second run stages nothing and a plain `git
commit` exits 1 — which would break the `&&` chain and skip `wring verify`,
the one command this step exists to run. The old `git add -A` hid that,
because there was always a fresh `.wringer/` to stage. Committing only when
something is actually staged fixes both halves at once.

## Step 8 — Run `wring doctor`, **from your clone**

`wring doctor` answers fourteen questions: six about this machine, eight
about the repository you are standing in. **Run it from the clone** — from
somewhere else the eight repository checks have nothing to look at and are
reported as skipped.

```bash
cd "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)" && wring doctor; echo "doctor exit: $?"
```

A real captured run, on a Mac with no container runtime installed:

```
✓ python                Python 3.12.13
✓ wring                 wring <version>, and all four commands resolve into /Users/you/.local/bin
✓ git                   git version 2.50.1 (Apple Git-155)
! container runtime     no container runtime found (Apple silicon detected)
                        → Install apple/container (needs macOS 26) or Docker Desktop — or skip the container and run wring directly
✓ git repository        /Users/you/wringer
✓ gates                 2 gate(s): lint, test; also configured: run
✓ runnable checks       2 declared and ready to run
! last verify           never run here, so nothing is known yet
                        → Run: wring verify
- pytest parallelism    no recorded duration for a pytest gate yet — run wring verify
✓ workspace writable    /Users/you/wringer/.wringer is writable
- worker auth           'python3' is a shell command with no login surface on the roster — the worker authenticates on its own account, and this check has nothing measured to ask it
- worker credential     the worker is a shell command with no roster entry for 'python3' — it authenticates on its own account, and this check has nothing measured to ask
✓ managed settings      no coding-agent policy file at /Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/managed-settings.json (absence here is not proof this machine is unmanaged — it is one path, checked)
! drafting key          no drafting key set — looked for ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, CODEX_API_KEY, KIMI_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY, WRINGER_API_KEY
                        → The DRAFTING lane: only needed for `wring judge --send` and for an agent driving `wring run`; this repo declares no name, so those are the well-known ones. The worker's credential is a separate lane, checked above. Provide it when you launch, and never paste it to an agent

Ready. The ! lines are optional extras, not problems. The - lines are checks this repository gave nothing to check.
doctor exit: 0
```

Paths and versions will differ; the check *names* will not — a test in this
repository fails if this transcript names a check `wring doctor` does not
have, **and now also if `wring doctor` has a check this transcript does not
name**. Both directions, because until 2026-08-30 only the first was
guarded, and this transcript had silently lost five of thirteen rows while
staying green.

Both transcripts on this page are captured output, recaptured on 2026-08-31
from the 0.6.0 working tree built into a fresh venv and run in a fresh clone
(the lane split renamed `llm key` to `drafting key` and added
`worker credential`). Three edits, all disclosed: the
home directory is anonymised (the machine prints `/Users/<its user>/…`); the
clone's path is written as the `~/wringer` this runbook assumes; and the
version is written `<version>` for the reason step 3 already gives —
*"pinning a number here would make the runbook wrong on the day of every
release"*. Nothing else was touched, and nothing was composed.

**And what "reported as skipped" actually looks like.** The paragraph above
tells you the three repository checks skip outside a repo, but the command
above cannot show you that — run from the clone, they never skip. So here is
the contrasting run, captured in an empty directory that is not a git
repository:

```bash
cd /tmp && mkdir -p not-a-repo && cd not-a-repo && wring doctor; echo "doctor exit: $?"
```

```
✓ python                Python 3.12.13
✓ wring                 wring <version>, and all four commands resolve into /Users/you/.local/bin
✓ git                   git version 2.50.1 (Apple Git-155)
! container runtime     no container runtime found (Apple silicon detected)
                        → Install apple/container (needs macOS 26) or Docker Desktop — or skip the container and run wring directly
- git repository        not a git repository — run from your repo to check
- gates                 not a git repository — run from your repo to check
- runnable checks       not a git repository — run from your repo to check
- last verify           not a git repository — run from your repo to check
- pytest parallelism    not a git repository — run from your repo to check
- workspace writable    not a git repository — run from your repo to check
- worker auth           not a git repository — run from your repo to check
- worker credential     not a git repository — run from your repo to check
✓ managed settings      no coding-agent policy file at /Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/managed-settings.json (absence here is not proof this machine is unmanaged — it is one path, checked)
! drafting key          no drafting key set — looked for ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, CODEX_API_KEY, KIMI_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY, WRINGER_API_KEY
                        → The DRAFTING lane: only needed for `wring judge --send` and for an agent driving `wring run`; this repo declares no name, so those are the well-known ones. The worker's credential is a separate lane, checked above. Provide it when you launch, and never paste it to an agent

This machine is ready. The ! lines are optional extras, not problems. The - lines describe a repository and were not checked here — run `wring doctor` from your repo for those.
doctor exit: 0
```

**Eight `-` lines, and the exit code is still `0`.** A skip is not a
failure: those eight checks had nothing to look at, and the closing line
says so rather than implying the machine is short of something.

**Read the marks, not the vibes:**

| mark | means | blocks setup? |
|---|---|---|
| `✓` | passed | no |
| `!` | worth knowing, not a problem — **exit stays `0`** | no |
| `-` | skipped, and the line says why | no |
| `✗` | blocking — **only these change the exit code** | yes |

**`! container runtime` and `! drafting key` are both expected here.** The key
arrives in step 9, from the human, and the runtime is step 4's business. A
`✗` maps back to a step above: re-run that step, then re-run `wring doctor`.

**What doctor does not check:** it cannot see whether the image was pulled
(step 5) or whether a bind mount works (step 7). Step 7 is what proves
those, and nothing else does.

If you are an agent, prefer:

```bash
wring doctor --json
```

It prints one object. **Branch on the exit code, not on the prose** — `0`
means nothing is blocking. Read the object to find out which check said
what; each carries `name`, `status` (`ok` / `warn` / `skip` / `fail`) and a
`fix` when there is something to do.

## Step 9 — Hand back to the human. Stop here.

Setup is done. **An agent's work ends at this line.** Do not run the launch
command, do not ask for a key, do not offer to set an environment variable.

Print this to the human, verbatim:

> Setup is complete. `wring doctor` passes on everything except the API key,
> which is yours to enter — I never handle it.
>
> Run these two yourself, in your own terminal. The first prompts for your
> key and does not echo it; the second starts the harness with it.

The key reaches the container as an environment variable, where Wringer's
redactor folds it into the set of values scrubbed out of every evidence
bundle *before* anything is written to disk. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## What good looks like

One end-to-end check, run by the human after step 9: the harness, in the
container, verifying a real repository and leaving evidence on the host's
disk.

> ⚠️ `.wringer.yaml` is code. `wring verify` runs the commands a repository
> declares, through a shell. Read a stranger's `.wringer.yaml` before you
> verify their repo — the container bounds the damage, it does not make the
> commands safe. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

> **The image ships Wringer, not your toolchain.** It has no `ruff`, no
> `pytest`, no `node` — deliberately: Wringer runs *your repo's* declared
> commands, and guessing which languages to bake in is the opposite of being
> vendor-neutral. So a gate that needs a tool needs that tool present, which
> for a real project means installing your dependencies into the workspace
> first, or mounting an environment that already has them. The check below
> uses a gate that needs nothing, so it tests the harness rather than your
> toolchain.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/wringer-workspace/probe && cd ~/wringer-workspace/probe
[ -d .git ] || git init -q -b main .
git config user.email you@example.com && git config user.name "You"
printf 'def add(a, b):\n    return a + b\n' > calc.py
printf 'version: 1\ngates:\n  - id: check\n    run: "grep -q return calc.py"\n' > .wringer.yaml
printf '.wringer/\n' > .gitignore
git add calc.py .wringer.yaml .gitignore
git diff --cached --quiet || git commit -qm probe

docker run --rm --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" -e HOME=/tmp \
  -v "$HOME/wringer-workspace:/workspace" \
  -w /workspace/probe ghcr.io/marcoakes/wringer:main verify
```

Apple container — same arguments, with Apple's flag spellings. `--user`,
`-e`, `--volume` and `--workdir` all exist on `container run`:

```bash
container run --rm --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" -e HOME=/tmp \
  --volume "$HOME/wringer-workspace:/workspace" \
  --workdir /workspace/probe ghcr.io/marcoakes/wringer:main verify
```

Verified on Apple `container` 1.2.0: exits 0, and every file in the bundle
lands owned by the invoking host user.

Correct output — one line per declared gate, then a path:

```
✓ check passed       0.0s

Evidence written to:
.wringer/runs/<run_id>/
```

Exit code `0`. The duration and the run id will differ from what is shown
here; the shape will not.

**`--user` and `-e HOME` are required on Linux, and harmless elsewhere.** The
image runs as uid 1000, a bind-mounted directory keeps its host ownership,
and Wringer must write its evidence into that mount. On **Linux** that fails
without these flags, which is why CI passes them on every push. **Apple
`container` translates uids across the mount, so the flags change nothing
there** — measured on 1.2.0: a flagless run exits 0 and the bundle lands
owned by the host user. **Docker Desktop on macOS is believed to behave the
same way, and nobody has ever checked** — it is the one combination neither
CI nor any field run has touched (see
[docs/MANUAL_CHECKS.md](docs/MANUAL_CHECKS.md)). Pass the flags anyway; one
recipe that is correct everywhere beats three that are each correct
somewhere.

One cosmetic surprise: `--user 502:20` reports `gid=20(dialout)` inside the
container. Group 20 is `staff` on macOS and `dialout` on Linux, and the
container resolves the number against its own group file. Harmless — but
confusing in a log, so it is written down here rather than discovered twice.

Then, back on the host:

```bash
ls ~/wringer-workspace/probe/.wringer/runs/
```

Correct output: at least one run directory. Inside it: `manifest.json`,
`evidence.jsonl`, `summary.md`, `digests.json`, `diff.patch`, `status.txt`,
and `gates/`.

`digests.json` is a sha256 of every other file in the bundle, written last
so it covers them all — that is what makes a later edit detectable. On this
clean probe `diff.patch` and `status.txt` are legitimately **empty**: there
were no uncommitted changes to describe.

That is the whole claim, checked — the harness ran in the container, the
gates really ran, and there is a bundle on your own disk to read rather than
a status to trust. If a gate *fails*, that is Wringer working correctly:
open `summary.md`, or run `wring explain`.
