# 2026-08-05, R2-07). The refusal to invent gates was RIGHT: that project
# declares no ruff, mypy or pytest anywhere, so there is nothing to gate, and
# guessing `pytest -q` is the cleverness detect.py exists not to do. The
# sentence was what was wrong, and it turned a correct refusal into what
# looked like a broken detector.
#
# These two cases are the fix's whole contract, and they are worth a test
# rather than a proofread because the old message was a module-level
# constant: nothing about it could be true of a repository it had never seen.
