"""One question, asked of the whole program: can a credential reach an artifact?

Every other redaction test in this suite is **per-path** — written by whoever
built that path, covering that path. That is exactly how two leaks shipped:

- `acp.py` handed the agent's stderr a raw file handle and wrote its session
  updates unscrubbed. Found 2026-08-06 while building `wring start`.
- `vacuity.py` ran the pre-change gates through `gates.run` with no redactor
  at all, so `--prove`'s logs got no scrubbing — not even the built-in
  `*TOKEN*`/`*SECRET*`/`*KEY*` defaults. Found the same day.

Both were new write paths into a bundle, and both needed somebody to remember
to test them. Twice nobody did. `AGENTS.md` already states the invariant —
*"If you add a file to the bundle, add it through the `Bundle`, or you have
quietly opted out of the one guarantee SECURITY.md makes"* — and nothing
enforced it.

This file enforces it, and it does so in the one way that survives future
carelessness: it does not enumerate write paths. It plants credentials in the
environment, drives the commands that produce artifacts, then walks **every
file under `.wringer/`** and asserts the values are in none of them. A write
path added next year is covered the day it is added, by nobody's diligence.

**It covers only the commands it DRIVES**, and that is the one place a new
bundle can still slip past. `wring graph` shipped a whole bundle family —
`.wringer/graphs/`, a staged intent file, a decision file, node references —
and none of it was swept until a `graph` run was added to the list below. Add
a command that writes artifacts, add it here in the same commit.

Two secrets, deliberately:

- `WRINGER_TEST_API_KEY` matches the redactor's default `*KEY*` pattern, so it
  is protected however the config is read.
- `WRINGER_TEST_CREDENTIAL` matches **none** of the defaults. The only thing
  that can save it is `config.declared_secret_names` reaching the redactor
  that write path used. It is the canary for the whole `env_passthrough`
  promise.
