    condition keeps the FIRST run's verdict beside a bundle that never made
    it — and a surviving `sensitive: true` row is one of the two receipts that
    evidence an acceptance criterion (SPEC_ACCEPT_V0 §3).

    Asserted against the clearing itself for the same reason the digests test
    is: a run that reaches the writers overwrites them either way, so a full
    verify would pass with or without the fix.
