"""The graph file and its validator (docs/specs/SPEC_GRAPH_V0.md §3).

A graph is a document before it is an execution, and every defect this
validator catches is one a person would otherwise meet halfway through a run
that had already spent a worker's time. So the rules are checked here, on the
file, with no execution anywhere in this module.

The two that matter most are not schema checks at all:

- **no `command:` anywhere** (ruling 1). The base plan let a node carry a
  shell string, which is arbitrary execution wearing a node costume. A
  stranger's graph file must be exactly as safe to validate and run as the
  same Wringer commands typed by hand.
- **dataflow** — a router that reads state nothing upstream writes is an
  authoring error the base plan could not see, and it fails at runtime as a
  route that silently never matches.
