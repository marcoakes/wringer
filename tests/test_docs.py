"""Guards on the documents and scripts that are meant to be run literally.

`SETUP.md` is not prose about how installation might go — it is a runbook an
agent is instructed to follow verbatim, one command at a time. A wrong
command in it is a defect of the same class as a wrong line of code, and it
is one that no unit test, review or type checker ever catches: the only thing
that finds it is a human or an agent running the runbook on a real machine.

Two field runs have now done exactly that (`docs/field-report-2026-08-04` in
history, `docs/field-report-2026-08-05.md` in the repo), and both reported
the same shape of finding: *a step whose gate had never been executed*. These
tests are the cheap half of the answer. They cannot prove a command works —
that needs the machine, and `docs/MANUAL_CHECKS.md` records those — but they
can prove a command that was measured to be wrong never comes back.

The field reports themselves are excluded from every guard here. They are
preserved verbatim as primary evidence, and their transcripts of the broken
commands are the whole point of keeping them.
