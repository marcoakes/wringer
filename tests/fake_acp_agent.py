"""A minimal agent that really speaks ACP, for the test suite.

Not a mock of Wringer's client — a separate process exchanging real
JSON-RPC over stdio, so the tests exercise the wire rather than the author's
idea of the wire. No network, no API key, no vendor binary: CI can run this
anywhere, which is the whole reason it exists.

Behaviour is chosen by argv so one file covers every case the loop needs:

    fix        write the file that makes the gate pass, via fs/write_text_file
    escape     try to write outside the repo (must be refused)
    permission ask for permission, then fix
    idle       do nothing and stop cleanly
    crash      exit mid-turn, before answering the prompt
    loudcrash  say something, THEN exit mid-turn — the shape where the
               agent's last words are the whole diagnostic value
    hang       accept the prompt and never answer
    deaf       answer session/new, then never read stdin again (pipe fills)
    garbage    emit a line that is not JSON, then behave
    noisy      flood stderr with far more than a pipe buffer holds, then
               fix. With stderr on a PIPE, nothing draining it means the
               agent blocks on write and the turn wedges.
    lastword   write to stderr and exit IMMEDIATELY — the bytes are in
               flight while the client is already stopping the process.
    leak       print a passed-through credential to stderr AND into a
               session/update, then fix. The shape §8 asks for: a secret
               planted in agent output, so a test can grep the bundle.
    usage      report token counts and a cost via usage_update — TWICE, so
               the cumulative-within-a-session rule has something to bite
               on — then fix.
    usageleak  report usage AND put a credential in the same notification,
               so the sibling file's own scrubbing is exercised rather than
               assumed.
