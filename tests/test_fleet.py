# --- E2: the deadline must reach the WORKER, not just the supervisor -------

# `_stop` killpg'd the child `wring run`'s process group. The worker runs in
# its OWN group — that is how gate timeouts kill a shell and everything it
# spawned — so it survived the fleet that was supposed to bound it. The
# comment at `_spawn` already said as much about child budgets: "the fleet's
# own deadline is no substitute, because it kills the supervisor rather than
# the worker burning the budget." This closes it, using the same pgid files
# `wring resume` already reads.
