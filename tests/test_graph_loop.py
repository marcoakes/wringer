"""The loop node and the router (SPEC_GRAPH_V0.md §3c, §3d).

The loop node **wraps** `loop.run` in process. It is not a subprocess and it
is not a second repair loop: `verify.py`'s founding rule is that shelling out
to yourself means parsing your own output, and in process is the only way the
loop's supervision machinery — pgid files, reaping, the breaker,
`wants_prove` — comes along intact.

Every loop outcome is a **routing fact, never a graph failure**. The node
completes and writes its status into state; the router decides what that
means. A graph that treated `max_iterations` as a crash could not express
"escalate to a human", which is the whole point of having a router.
