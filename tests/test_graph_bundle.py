"""The graph run bundle (docs/specs/SPEC_GRAPH_V0.md §4).

Every house rule the other bundles obey, and for the reasons this month
supplied rather than out of symmetry:

- **chained from day one**, so `wring audit`'s machinery covers graph runs
  without a retrofit;
- **a redactor built from `declared_secret_names` on every write**, because
  two of this month's leaks were write paths that skipped one;
- **`state.json` is a convenience snapshot and the ledger is the truth**, so
  a doctored snapshot changes nothing;
- **`digests.json` last**, covering everything else the run wrote.
