"""`wring verify --prove` — docs/specs/SPEC_VACUITY_V0.md.

> **"Prove the gates can fail."** The agent wrote tautological tests, its
> gates pass, and the green tick means nothing. The counter is deterministic:
> if the gates still pass *without* the change, they never tested it.

The section that matters most here is §4b, and it is the reason this file
opens with the false-`proven` cases rather than the happy path. A detached
worktree carries **tracked files and nothing else**, so in a repo whose
dependencies are gitignored every pre-change gate fails on a missing
environment — and §1's comparison table reads that as PROOF. The feature built
to catch reward-hacking would certify it, on every run, however tautological
the tests.
