# A process whose SIGINT is SIG_IGN cannot be interrupted, and neither can its
# children — dispositions are inherited across fork and exec. So these two tests
# CANNOT pass in a background or `nohup`'d job, and the failure they produce is
# about the invocation rather than about the code.
#
# **This was diagnosed wrongly once, on 2026-08-13.** A `nohup`'d
# `scripts/ci-repro.sh` reported both as `subprocess.TimeoutExpired` against their
# 20s/30s ceilings, and the ceilings were raised to 120s on the theory that they
# were measuring a loaded machine. They were not: the signal was being dropped, so
# `sleep 30` ran to completion and `wring verify` exited 0. Raising the ceiling
# only changed the symptom from a timeout to a clean pass, and made a genuine hang
# six times slower to surface. The ceilings are back where they were, and this is
# the guard that should have been written instead.
