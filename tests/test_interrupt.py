# broken implementation still fails, because it never stops at all and the
# ceiling is reached however large it is. A tight ceiling only adds a second
# failure mode: a loaded machine.

# Both were 20s/30s, chosen on a quiet machine, and both timed out in a fresh
# `scripts/ci-repro.sh` clone on 2026-08-13 — the whole suite under `-n auto`
# took 338s that run, against 65s unloaded, and these two tests spawn a real
# `python -m wringer` with cold imports in a fresh venv. Raising them removes a
# threshold that was reporting the machine's load as a defect in the signal
# handling; nothing about what they guard changes.
