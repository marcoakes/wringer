# SPEC — `wring verify` v0.1.0, the standalone evidence compiler

*Adopted 2026-07-30 (third external review). This is the **binding
implementation contract** for v0.1.0. It supersedes the Days 1–30 detail
in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) where they differ. The implementing agent
builds THIS, in the build order below, and nothing in [Non-goals](#non-goals-for-v010-binding).*

## Positioning

> **One command that proves whether this change is mergeable, and leaves
> behind evidence a human or agent can inspect.**

`wring verify` ships **before** `wring run`, before the graph IR, before
judges, before Temporal, before any agent integration. It is not "the
verifier inside Wringer" — it is a standalone evidence compiler that
happens to become Wringer's foundation. After an AI coding session,
`wring verify` gives a cleaner, more reviewable truth trail than the
agent's own summary. Once that lands, `wring run` becomes obvious: a loop
that keeps calling `wring verify` until the evidence says stop.

## The one job

```
input:  repo + config + current git state
action: run gates in order
output: .wringer/runs/<run_id>/
        manifest.json
        evidence.jsonl
        summary.md
        diff.patch
        status.txt
        gates/<NNN>_<id>/{stdout.log, stderr.log, result.json}
```

## CLI surface

### `wring init`

Detects common project commands and writes `.wringer.yaml`. If detection is
uncertain, **generate comments rather than being clever**.

When detection finds real commands, it writes them — the shape below.

```yaml
version: 1
gates:
  - id: format
    run: make format-check
    optional: true
  - id: lint
    run: make lint
  - id: test
    run: make test
evidence:
  include:
    - git.diff
    - git.status
    - env
    - logs
```

When it finds nothing to gate it writes a **template**, not a guess
(amended 2026-08-05, field report R2-07/R2-08). The template says which
build-config files it did see, so a correct refusal to invent gates cannot
read as a broken detector, and its single gate is a `placeholder` that
passes:

```yaml
gates:
  - id: placeholder
    run: "true"
```

That makes a first `wring init && wring verify` exit 0 on a healthy tree
rather than red — the examples above are shipped commented out. **A passing
placeholder must never be silent**: while every required gate is still the
untouched placeholder, `wring verify` says so on the terminal and in
`summary.md`, because a bundle whose result reads `passed` must not be
readable as "verified" when nothing was proven. That condition is detected
by comparing against the shipped template's own constants; it is **not** a
manifest field, because `wringer.evidence.v1` is frozen.

### `wring verify`

Runs gates, writes the evidence bundle.

```bash
wring verify
wring verify --changed-only   # NOT REGISTERED — see the note below
wring verify --json
wring verify --output .wringer/runs/manual-001
wring verify --gate test
```

> **`--changed-only` is deliberately unregistered.** This spec names it and
> never defines it, and the plausible readings — skip a clean tree · scope
> gates to changed files · limit what is captured — are different products. A
> flag that half-works is worse than a missing one because agents consume this
> CLI, so it stays out until the semantics are pinned here. `AGENTS.md` §"Do
> not add these early" carries the reasoning; typing it today is an argparse
> error, which is the honest outcome.

**Exit codes are contract:**

| code | meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | all required gates passed |
| 1 | a required gate failed |
| 2 | config or environment error |
| 3 | unsafe dirty state / refused precondition |
| 4 | interrupted |

`wring verify --json` emits structured back-pressure for agents (Claude
Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI — they need structure, not prose):

```json
{
  "status": "failed",
  "failed_gate": "test",
  "rerun": "wring verify --gate test",
  "evidence_dir": ".wringer/runs/20260730-070601-a13f",
  "template_only": false
}
```

`template_only` (amended 2026-08-05) is `true` while every required gate is
still the placeholder `wring init` writes. An agent is the reader most
likely to act on a bare `"status": "passed"`, and it is the one reader the
terminal's `!` line cannot reach — so the fact that a run proved nothing has
to be in the object too. Present even when `false`: a consumer should never
have to distinguish "not a template" from "the tool forgot to tell me".
This is CLI surface, not `wringer.evidence.v1` — no frozen schema moves.

### `wring explain`

Reads the latest (or named) failed run and gives a compact diagnosis —
**non-LLM in v0**: failing gate, command, exit code, last useful log
lines, changed files, and the exact rerun command.

```bash
wring explain
wring explain .wringer/runs/2026-07-30T070601Z
```

## The evidence bundle (this is the product)

Boring, stable, grep-friendly. This format is the interface future
agents and judges consume — see [RFC #2](https://github.com/marcoakes/wringer/issues/2).

```
.wringer/runs/20260730-070601-a13f/
  manifest.json
  evidence.jsonl
  summary.md
  diff.patch
  status.txt
  gates/
    001_lint/
      stdout.log
      stderr.log
      result.json
    002_test/
      stdout.log
      stderr.log
      result.json
```

The run directory's name is stamped in **UTC** (amended 2026-08-05: a
field run measured host and container runs of one repository sorting
against each other, because both ids were local and the container was not
in the host's timezone). `ts` and `started_at` stay local-with-offset —
they are what a human reads, and the offset is the part they want. The id
is what gets *sorted*, so it names one instant from everywhere. Readers
should still order runs by `started_at` rather than by the name; `--output`
lets a caller name a directory anything.

`evidence.jsonl` — append-only, one JSON object per line. Every event
carries `type` and a millisecond-precision local `ts` (amended
2026-07-30, Bolt 3: an audit trail needs to be placeable in time):

```json
{"type":"run.started","ts":"2026-07-30T08:06:01.004+01:00","run_id":"20260730-070601-a13f","wringer_version":"0.1.0","repo":"wringer","sha":"abc123"}
{"type":"git.status","ts":"2026-07-30T08:06:01.031+01:00","dirty":true,"changed_files":["src/foo.py","tests/test_foo.py"]}
{"type":"gate.started","ts":"2026-07-30T08:06:01.033+01:00","gate_id":"lint","command":"make lint"}
{"type":"gate.finished","ts":"2026-07-30T08:06:02.875+01:00","gate_id":"lint","exit_code":0,"duration_ms":1842}
{"type":"gate.started","ts":"2026-07-30T08:06:02.877+01:00","gate_id":"test","command":"make test"}
{"type":"gate.finished","ts":"2026-07-30T08:06:12.108+01:00","gate_id":"test","exit_code":1,"duration_ms":9231,"log":"gates/002_test/stdout.log"}
{"type":"run.finished","ts":"2026-07-30T08:06:12.110+01:00","status":"failed","failed_gate":"test"}
```

`manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "wringer.evidence.v1",
  "run_id": "20260730-070601-a13f",
  "started_at": "2026-07-30T08:06:01+01:00",
  "repo": {
    "root": ".",
    "head_sha": "abc123",
    "branch": "main",
    "dirty": true
  },
  "result": {
    "status": "failed",
    "failed_gate": "test"
  }
}
```

## Config design (keep it tiny)

```yaml
version: 1

gates:
  - id: lint
    run: make lint
    timeout: 120
    required: true

  - id: test
    run: make test
    timeout: 300
    required: true

evidence:
  redact:
    env:
      - "*TOKEN*"
      - "*SECRET*"
      - "*KEY*"
```

**Rules (binding):**

1. Gates run cheapest first.
2. Stop on first required failure by default.
3. Optional gates record failure but do not fail the run.
4. Every command gets stdout, stderr, exit code, duration, timeout status.
5. Secrets are redacted **before** writing evidence.
6. Nothing uploads anywhere. Ever.

## Why this beats `make test`

1. **Evidence, not just pass/fail** — what was checked, what changed,
   what passed, what failed, where the logs are, what commit and
   environment produced it.
2. **Gate contracts** — the project declares what "done" means (this is
   the embryo of the later loop contract).
3. **Agent-readable output** — `--json` is structured back-pressure any
   coding agent can consume.

## Implementation stack

**Python 3.11+** for v0 (third-review ruling: ubiquitous, inspectable,
easy to package, right audience; `pipx install wringer`). Keep
dependencies minimal — **argparse + dataclasses preferred**; add PyYAML
for config; nothing else without cause. The TypeScript monorepo remains
the plan's shape for the later graph engine — revisit at v0.2.

```
wringer/
  pyproject.toml
  src/wringer/
    __main__.py
    cli.py
    config.py
    detect.py
    git.py
    gates.py
    evidence.py
    redact.py
    summary.py
  tests/
    fixtures/
```

## Build order (bolts — plan first, verify each before the next)

- **Day 1 — skeleton:** `wring --help`, `wring init`, `wring verify` with
  hardcoded config support, one gate, writes `evidence.jsonl`.
- **Day 2 — gate runner:** multiple gates, timeouts, stop-on-failure,
  stdout/stderr logs, exit codes, `summary.md`.
- **Day 3 — git evidence:** root detection, branch, HEAD SHA, dirty
  status, changed files, `diff.patch`, untracked list.
- **Day 4 — redaction & safety:** env redaction patterns, max log size,
  binary exclusion, safe failure outside a git repo.
- **Day 5 — dogfood:** Wringer verifies Wringer. Commit a sanitized
  demo bundle (`.wringer.example/runs/...`). Wire CI to run `wring verify`.

## Definition of PROVEN — the repo must show its own receipts

**Do not tag `v0.1.0` until every line is true:**

- [x] `pipx install wringer` works — **published to PyPI 2026-07-31**;
      verified by installing `wringer==0.1.0` from PyPI into a clean venv and
      running `wring init` → `wring verify` to a green run and a real bundle
- [x] `wring init` works in an empty-ish Python repo — detects ruff/pytest/
      mypy from `pyproject.toml`, npm scripts, and Makefile targets
- [x] `wring verify` runs at least two gates
- [x] failed gates produce useful logs
- [x] evidence bundle format is stable and documented
- [x] **CI runs `wring verify` on this repo** and uploads the bundle
- [x] **Wringer itself uses `wring verify`** — [`.wringer.yaml`](.wringer.yaml)
      declares its gates and a real bundle is committed to
      [`.wringer.example/`](.wringer.example/)
- [x] README shows a **real transcript**, not aspirational syntax

The README demo at that point:

```
$ wring verify
✓ git status captured
✓ diff captured
✓ lint passed        1.8s
✗ test failed        9.2s

Evidence written to:
.wringer/runs/20260730-070601-a13f/

Next:
  open .wringer/runs/20260730-070601-a13f/summary.md
  rerun wring verify --gate test
```

## Non-goals for v0.1.0 (binding)

`wring run` · LLM judge · GitHub issue ingestion · PR creation · Temporal ·
OpenTelemetry · multi-agent anything · cost tracking beyond an optional
empty `cost.jsonl` placeholder · sandboxing beyond "record current repo
state". All valuable; all after the first trust moment.

## First public benchmark (post-v0.1)

Benchmark against messiness, not against LangGraph: does a coding agent
fix a bug faster given `wring verify --json` output; does a maintainer
review an AI PR faster with evidence attached; can repeated failures be
grouped by signature. Three demo repos suffice: pytest package,
npm-test package, generic make repo.

## Appendix — session bootstrap for the implementing agent

Paste at the start of the implementation session:

> You are implementing **Wringer v0.1.0** per `SPEC_VERIFY_V0.md` in
> `~/Claude/wringer` (github.com/marcoakes/wringer). Read `AGENTS.md`,
> then the spec end to end, then `ROADMAP.md`. Rules: (1) AI-DLC — plan
> the current Day-bolt first, wait for approval, then execute. (2) Build
> order = the spec's Day 1–5; do not skip ahead. (3) The spec's non-goals
> are binding — no `wring run`, no LLM calls, no PR machinery. (4) Python
> 3.11+, argparse + dataclasses, PyYAML only; `pyproject.toml`, `src/wringer/`
> layout, pytest. (5) Small conventional commits; never claim a bolt done
> unless its checks actually ran. (6) The finish line is the spec's
