# SPEC — `wring judge` v0.2, slice 2: the rubric judge

*Drafted 2026-07-31 by synthesis of four independent designs (minimalism,
contract-first, safety, testability lenses), each adversarially reviewed.
**ADOPTED 2026-07-31** — the maintainer approved §9's wording, which was the
last open question. [SPEC_VERIFY_V0.md](SPEC_VERIFY_V0.md) and
[SPEC_RUN_V0.md](SPEC_RUN_V0.md) remain binding and unchanged.*

## Positioning

> **The gates said the change works. A judge says whether it is the change
> that was asked for — and shows you exactly what it was told.**

`wring judge` reads a *finished* evidence bundle and a rubric the repo wrote,
and produces a structured verdict. It is a standalone command over a
completed artifact, the way `wring verify` shipped before `wring run` — not a
stage buried inside the loop.

That shape is not a convenience. It is what makes worker/judge isolation
**physical**: the judge reads `.wringer/runs/<id>/`, while everything a worker
ever said lives in `.wringer/loops/<id>/iterations/`. The two trees do not
overlap, so a worker's reasoning cannot reach a judge because there is no code
path along which it could travel.

**Deterministic gates always run first, and a judge never overrides them.**

## 1. The one genuinely new thing

This is the first command in Wringer's history that can open a socket. Every
line of the design below exists to make that fact loud, auditable, and
impossible to trigger by accident.

Three mechanisms carry it:

1. **Dry run is the default.** `wring judge` assembles everything, writes the
   exact request body to disk, and exits **without opening a socket**.
   `--send` is the only way to transmit, and there is no config key and no
   environment variable that can imply it. The word is typed by a human or it
   does not happen.
2. **No default endpoint and no default model, ever.** The same law as
   `run.worker`. A repo with no `judge:` section has no reachable code path
   in the program that opens a connection.
3. **`request.json` is written before the socket opens.** What leaves the
   machine is therefore auditable rather than asserted, and `--dry-run` is
   literally the same code path stopping one step earlier — not a separate
   branch that might drift.

## 2. CLI surface

```bash
wring judge                      # dry run against the latest bundle: builds, sends nothing
wring judge RUN_DIR              # judge a named bundle instead of the latest
wring judge --send               # opens a socket; see SPEC_GET_V0 §7 for the full list
wring judge --print-request      # write the exact would-be body to stdout, exit 0
wring judge --rubric PATH        # override the configured rubric
wring judge --json               # one object on stdout, no human report
```

**Exit codes.** `0`–`4` keep the meanings the other commands gave them; `5`
is new.

> **Restated for P7** (SPEC_GRAPH_V0.md §5.3, which amends this sentence by
> name). This read *"and belongs to `wring judge` alone"*. It does not any
> more: `wring graph run` and `wring graph resume` return `5` for a **parked**
> graph, because that is the same claim this command makes with it —
> *nothing was decided; a person must act*. `0` there would make `wring graph
> run && deploy` ship a graph nobody approved, and `1` would page someone for
> a graph that is merely waiting for them. The family is now three commands
> and one meaning, not two meanings sharing a number.
>
> Everything else is unchanged, and provably: `wring verify` and `wring run`
> still never return `5`, guarded below. Nor do `wring graph status` and
> `wring graph explain` — they report on the claim, they do not make it.
>
> This restatement was owed by the commit that registered the graph CLI
> (`595d791`) and was missed there; it is written here rather than quietly
> left, which is the same rule SPEC_GET_V0 §7 follows.

| code | meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | verdict `pass` — every required criterion met. Also a successful dry run, which says so on its first line. |
| 1 | verdict `fail` — a required criterion was not met |
| 2 | config or environment error (no `judge:` section, no rubric, unreadable bundle, `api_key_env` names an unset variable, an endpoint the safety rules reject) |
| 3 | refused — **the bundle's required gates did not pass**, or it records an interrupted run |
| 4 | interrupted |
| 5 | verdict `needs_human` — nothing competent reached a conclusion |

**`5` must never be folded into `1`.** "The evidence says no" and "nothing
competent looked at the evidence" are different claims, and this repo does not
conflate them. A transport failure, a timeout, an unparseable reply, or a
criterion the model declined to score all produce `5`.

**Gates-failed is a refusal, not a verdict.** When the deterministic gates
already said no, a judge has nothing to add and no request is built.

A test asserts `wring verify` and `wring run` can never return `5`.

## 3. Config — the `judge:` section

```yaml
judge:
  endpoint: http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1/chat/completions
  model: qwen2.5-coder:7b
  rubric: rubric.yaml
  api_key_env: OPENAI_API_KEY   # optional — the NAME of a variable, never a key
  timeout: 120                  # optional, default 120, integer >= 1
  max_output_tokens: 8000       # optional, default 8000, integer >= 1
  draft_in_sections: false      # optional, default false — `wring spec` only
```

**`draft_in_sections` (0.9.9).** `wring spec --send` drafts the plan in one
call by default. With this on it drafts in three — the requirements, then
the decisions and bindings given the requirements, then the tasks given both
— and each call's request and reply are written to disk **before the next
call is made**. A reply cut off at the ceiling then costs that call: the
calls before it are read back from the exchange that paid for them and are
not sent again, including when the ceiling is raised, which is the move the
stop recommends and which changes every call's bytes.

The exchange under `.wringer/specs/<id>/` then holds:

```
request.json      # the single-call head. In sectioned mode it is NOT sent:
                  # it is what a redraft is matched against, so the ledger
                  # and the plain guard compare documents, and `summary.md`
                  # says so rather than pointing a reader at it.
request-N.json    # the bytes of call N, as sent
response-N.json   # call N's reply, as it arrived
response.json     # the three assembled into one reply's shape, written only
                  # when every call answered. `assembled_from` names the
                  # calls this exchange sent, `reused_from` names the
                  # exchange that already paid for each call it did not, and
                  # `usage` is the sum of the calls it sent alone — omitted
                  # entirely, with `usage_missing_from` naming the gap, if a
                  # call reported none.
```

The engine's default stays off until sectioned drafting has been through a
blind run; `wringer-drive` writes it on in the config it generates, because
the drive is the surface a cut-off reply cost a run its whole blind phase
on (run 5, 2026-09-05).

> **AMENDED 2026-08-19.** This default was `1024` when the spec was written
> and is `8000` now. The change is recorded here rather than in a note beside
> a stale number because a spec is a contract for what is built, not a
> capture of a run: a reader has to be able to take its config block
> literally. The reason is that `wring spec` reuses this section, and a real
> PRD's draft does not fit in 1024 tokens — the whole reply is then refused
> and nothing is written. `wring judge`'s own replies are small and are
> unaffected. Nothing else in this section moved.

**Rules (binding):**

1. `endpoint`, `model` and `rubric` are **required, with no defaults, ever.**
   Wringer contacts the endpoint you wrote down and never one it guessed.
2. **Endpoint safety, checked at parse time:** `https://` anywhere, `http://`
   **only** to loopback. No userinfo (`user:pass@`) and no query string —
   credentials never travel in a URL, and the URL is recorded in the bundle.
3. `api_key_env` names an **environment variable**. Wringer will not read a
   credential from a config file, and the key never appears in config, in
   argv, or in any artifact. **The named variable's value is folded into the
   redactor**, so it cannot reach a bundle even if something echoes it.
   Omitted means no `Authorization` header at all — the Ollama case. Named
   but unset is exit 2, before anything is built.
4. Unknown keys under `judge:` are errors, as everywhere else.
5. A config carrying `judge:` needs Wringer ≥ 0.2. `wring verify` and
   `wring run` neither read it nor care.

Cheap models are the point — this is a rubric check over a diff, not a
reasoning contest — but that is a documented recommendation, never a fallback
the code applies.

## 4. The rubric — `wringer.rubric.v1`

Its own file, not inline in `.wringer.yaml`: its bytes get sent over a wire,
so it needs its own shape and size limits, and the config stays tiny.

```yaml
schema_version: wringer.rubric.v1
title: Acceptance criteria
criteria:
  - id: tests-cover-the-change
    title: The change is covered by a test
    guidance: A new behaviour needs a test that fails without it.
    required: true
  - id: no-scope-creep
    title: No unrelated changes
    guidance: The diff should touch only what the task needed.
    required: false
```

Repo-relative, must resolve **inside the repo root** (no `..`, no symlink
escape), ≤ 32 KB, ≤ 20 criteria, ids are slugs like gate ids. Not under
`.wringer/` — that is gitignored, and a rubric is source, not evidence.

## 5. What the judge is allowed to see

**A closed list.** The request builder's signature is
`build_request(evidence_dir: Path, rubric: Rubric) -> dict` — there is no
parameter that could carry a loop, an iteration, a brief or a worker log, so
passing one is a type error rather than a review comment.

It reads exactly:

1. the rubric — title, and each criterion's id, title and guidance;
2. `diff.patch` from the bundle, truncated at 64 KB with a declared marker;
3. the gate table — id, command, exit code, duration, status;
4. repo facts — HEAD sha, branch, dirty flag.

Everything else in the bundle, and the whole of `.wringer/loops/`, is out of
scope by construction.

## 6. The verdict — `.wringer/verdicts/<id>/`, `wringer.judge.v1`

Evidence bundles are referenced by path, never copied — the ruling the loop
already established.

```
.wringer/verdicts/20260731-104200-9c1e/
  verdict.json     # the contract
  request.json     # the exact bytes sent, or that would be sent
  response.json    # the raw reply; absent in dry run and on transport failure
  summary.md       # for people
```

```json
{
  "schema_version": "wringer.judge.v1",
  "verdict_id": "20260731-104200-9c1e",
  "started_at": "2026-07-31T10:42:00+01:00",
  "mode": "dry_run",
  "evidence_dir": ".wringer/runs/20260731-091500-4b2a",
  "rubric": {"path": "rubric.yaml", "sha256": "3f1c…"},
  "endpoint": "http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1/chat/completions",
  "model": "qwen2.5-coder:7b",
  "verdict": "pass",
  "criteria": [
    {"id": "tests-cover-the-change", "met": true, "required": true, "reason": "…"}
  ],
  "duration_ms": 1840
}
```

**There is deliberately no `judge.jsonl`.** An event log orders things that
happen over time; a judgment is one request and one reply, and `verdict.json`
already carries `started_at` and `duration_ms`. That absence is a ruling, not
an oversight — the one place this slice departs from the bundle house style.

## 7. Testability

Everything below runs in CI with **no network and no API key**:

- **Dry run is the default**, so most tests never approach a transport.
- **A fake transport** is injected for `--send` paths; the live transport is
  one small stdlib `urllib` function, and the only untested line is the socket
  itself.
- **The isolation test that must fail loudly:** run a full `wring run` loop
  whose worker prints a distinctive sentinel string, then build a judge
  request from the resulting bundle and assert the sentinel appears **nowhere**
  in `request.json`.
- **Recorded fixtures** stand in for model replies: a pass, a fail, a
  `needs_human`, a malformed body, a timeout.
- Following the house taste, the loop and gate tests keep spawning real
  processes; only the network is faked, because a socket in CI is the one
  thing that would make the suite flaky.

## 8. Non-goals for this slice (binding)

Streaming · retries or fallback models · multiple judges or quorum ·
judge-in-the-loop (`wring run` calling the judge automatically — a later
slice, once the verdict contract has proved itself) · cost ledger ·
per-criterion numeric scoring beyond met/not-met · issue ingestion · PR or MR
creation · any git write · OpenTelemetry.

## 9. The network promise — DECIDED 2026-07-31

Wringer currently advertises, in [README.md](../../README.md) line 57 and without
qualification: **"No LLM, no cloud, no uploads."**

The scoped promises survive this slice untouched — SECURITY.md's "No network"
is written about `wring verify` specifically, and `SPEC_VERIFY_V0.md` rule 6
and `evidence.py` are likewise about the evidence writer. But that README
sentence describes the *product*, and it would become false the first time
anyone types `--send`.

In a repo whose entire pitch is evidence, a stale absolute claim is worse than
a feature nobody shipped. **The maintainer approved this replacement on
2026-07-31; it is now the binding wording:**

> No LLM and no network — by default, and in every command that proves
> anything. `wring judge --send` was the single exception when this was written; P2 and P3 added `wring spec --send` and `wring deliver --send`, and `wring get`/`wring issue` fetch. See SPEC_GET_V0 §7. It exists only when
> your repo declares an endpoint, it writes the exact bytes to disk before it
> opens a socket, and it never runs unless you type `--send`.

**When it lands: with J2, not before.** The sentence describes `--send`, so
publishing it while `--send` is still stubbed would make the README describe
behaviour the program does not have — the same sin in the other direction.
J1 ships dry-run-only against the *existing* wording, which stays true
because nothing has opened a socket yet; J2 flips the transport on and edits
[README.md](../../README.md) line 57 and [SECURITY.md](../../SECURITY.md)'s "What Wringer
never does" in the same commit.

## 10. Definition of DONE

- [ ] `wring judge` dry-runs against a real bundle and writes a verdict bundle
- [ ] a bundle whose gates failed is refused (exit 3), with no request built
- [ ] `--send` against a fake transport produces pass / fail / needs_human
- [ ] a malformed or timed-out reply produces `needs_human` (exit 5), never `fail`
- [ ] the sentinel test proves no worker output reaches `request.json`
- [ ] an endpoint violating the safety rules is rejected at parse time
- [ ] `api_key_env`'s value is redacted everywhere, and absent from `request.json`
- [ ] `wring verify` and `wring run` provably cannot return 5
- [ ] schemas published under `schema/`, with the drift test extended
- [ ] docs carry a real captured transcript of a dry run
