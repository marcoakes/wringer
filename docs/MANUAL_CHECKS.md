# Manual checks — what CI structurally cannot run

Some of this project's claims cannot be tested by any workflow, on any
runner, ever. Not "we have not got round to it": **structurally cannot**.
GitHub's macOS runners have no nested virtualization, so `container system
start` cannot work there, so the entire Apple `container` path is beyond
CI's reach by construction. The Docker-stub check (R2-02) is beyond it for a
different reason — it needs a machine with a stripped `Docker.app` to look
at, which is a state you inherit rather than create.

The honest answer to that is not to quietly assume those paths work. It is
to make the manual coverage **recorded and dated**, so anyone can see how
old the evidence is and what it actually covered.

**If you run one of these sequences, add a row.** A check nobody wrote down
is a check nobody ran — this file is subject to law 1 like everything else.

## Coverage record

**Last passed** — one row per host that has actually executed a sequence.

### About the 2026-08-05 Apple row

This is a **captured fact**, and it is worth being exact about what it
covers, because it is the only evidence the Apple path has.

On 2026-08-05 a clean, MDM-managed macOS 26 Apple-silicon host executed
`SETUP.md` at `75167c2` end to end — the first execution of the Apple
`container` path by anyone. It proved a great deal: the published image
pulled, `container` started, the bind mount resolved, real gates ran, and a
complete seven-artefact evidence bundle landed on the host **owned by the
host user** (`502:20`) from a process running as uid 1000 inside the
container. Exit 0. The full transcript is preserved verbatim in
[field-report-2026-08-05.md](field-report-2026-08-05.md).

What it does **not** mean: that the runbook as written at `75167c2` worked.
It did not. `SETUP.md` said `container images pull`, which does not exist
(AC-01), and the operator got there by correcting the command by hand. The
runbook was then rewritten from that run's captured output — but **the
rewritten text has never itself been executed on an Apple host.** It is
transcribed evidence, not re-verified evidence.

So the next Apple run has a specific job: run the rewritten sequence
verbatim, change nothing, and add a row. Until then the Apple row says
"passed with corrections applied by hand", because that is what happened.

### About the Docker Desktop row

`--user`/`-e HOME` behaviour is genuinely runtime-specific — AC-02 measured
Apple `container` translating uids across a bind mount, exactly unlike
Linux. CI covers Docker on Linux and one field run covers Apple `container`.
**Nobody has ever run Wringer under Docker Desktop on macOS**, and SETUP.md
makes claims about it. That makes it this project's largest untested
surface, and it is listed here so it is visible rather than assumed.

---

## Sequence A — the Apple `container` path

**Requires:** macOS 26 on Apple silicon. **Time:** about ten minutes, most
of it the pull. **No API key is involved at any point** — if any step asks
for one, stop: that is a bug in the runbook, not a step to complete.

Run these from a clone of this repository, verbatim from `SETUP.md`. The
point is to execute what the runbook *says*, not what you know it means. If
a command needs correcting to work, that correction is a finding — record it
rather than fixing it silently and reporting a pass.

- [ ] **1. In the repo.** `git rev-parse --show-toplevel && grep -m1 '^name = ' pyproject.toml`
      → an absolute path, then `name = "wringer"`.
- [ ] **2. Host prerequisites.** SETUP.md step 2's interpreter loop
      → any git version, and at least one line reporting Python 3.11+.
      A stock `python3 -> 3.9.x` alongside a qualifying one is fine.
- [ ] **3. Install `wring`.** `uv tool install --force --python 3.12 .`
      → `wring --version` starts `wring 0.2`, then `doctor present`.
      Note **where** it landed; `uv tool install` uses `~/.local/bin`.
- [ ] **4. Pick the runtime.** `uname -s -m; sw_vers -productVersion`
      → `Darwin arm64` and `26.` or higher, so 4A is eligible.
- [ ] **4A. `container --version`** → `1.2.0` or later. A truncated
      `commit: unspeci` is Apple's own output, not damage.
- [ ] **4A. Install if missing** — `brew install container` (a *formula*,
      not a cask; no admin password). The install is the human's to run.
- [ ] **4A. `container system start`**, then `container system status`
      → a **table**, with the row `status  running`. A blank `logRoot` is
      normal.
- [ ] **5. `container image pull ghcr.io/marcoakes/wringer:main`**
      → exit 0. **`image`, singular.** Apple unpacks *every* architecture in
      the index, so a ~160 MB pull lands as roughly 470 MB on disk.
- [ ] **5. `container image list | grep wringer`** → exactly one row naming
      the image.
- [ ] **6. Workspace.** `mkdir -p ~/wringer-workspace` and the write probe
      → `workspace writable`.
- [ ] **7. The image runs and sees the mount.** `container run --rm --volume
      "$HOME/wringer-workspace:/workspace" --workdir /workspace
      ghcr.io/marcoakes/wringer:main --version`
      → the same `wring 0.2…` line, from inside the container. **The first
      `container run` on a machine** fetches a kernel and a ~66 MB init
      image behind a six-stage ladder, taking about ten seconds. Expected,
      once.
- [ ] **8. `wring doctor` from the clone** → exit 0; the `!` lines for
      container runtime and llm key are expected.
- [ ] **8. `wring doctor` from a directory that is not a repo** → exit 0,
      and **three `-` lines**. (`setup-selftest.sh` asserts this too, so a
      disagreement between them is itself a finding.)
- [ ] **9. Hand back.** No key touched at any point in the sequence.
- [ ] **End to end.** The "What good looks like" probe, run through
      `container run … verify` → exit 0, a bundle on disk, and **every file
      in it owned by your host uid:gid**, not by uid 1000. Check with
      `ls -lan`.
- [ ] **AC-02, both ways.** Run the same verify **without** `--user` and
      `-e HOME`. On Apple `container` it should also exit 0 and also land
      owned by the host user — the flags are required on Linux and harmless
      here. If it *fails* on your host, that is a finding and SETUP.md's
      three-runtime paragraph is wrong.
- [ ] **Record it.** Add a row to the coverage table above: host, OS,
      runtime version, date, commit, result.

---

## Sequence B — the Docker Desktop path on macOS

**Never run by anyone.** There is no checklist here yet because writing one
from imagination is how the last set of findings happened — a runbook whose
steps had never been executed. Whoever runs this first should follow
`SETUP.md`'s 4B/5/7 branch verbatim, write down what actually happened, and
turn that into this section.

The one thing worth knowing in advance: AC-02 claims Docker Desktop
translates uids across a bind mount the way Apple `container` does. That
claim is **inherited from an older draft of SETUP.md and has never been
measured.** Measuring it is the most valuable thing this sequence can do.

---

## Sequence C — the Docker stub check (R2-02)

**Requires:** a machine where `/Applications/Docker.app` exists as a
removal leftover — typically an MDM-managed Mac where Docker Desktop was
uninstalled centrally. You cannot usefully create this state; you either
have it or you do not.

- [ ] `docker version --format '{{.Server.Version}}'` → `command not found`.
- [ ] `ls -ld /Applications/Docker.app` → something shaped like
      `d---------  2 root  admin  64`. **`-ld`, not `-la`**: the stripped
      permissions are exactly what stops `ls -la` reading the directory, so
      the plural-listing form returns `Permission denied` and tells you
      nothing.
- [ ] Confirm the diagnosis holds: no binary inside, no socket. This is a
      leftover, not an install, and clearing it needs privileges — it is the
      human's or their IT's to do, never the agent's.
- [ ] **Record it.** Add a row above.

---

## Sequence D — an attestation over a *signed* commit

**Status: unverified. Never run by anyone.**

`wring attest` records what `git log -1 --format=%G?` says about the delivered
commit's signature (`G` good, `B` bad, `U` untrusted, `N` none) plus the
reported signer, verbatim, and `wring audit` reports it without re-verifying.
The unsigned half is covered by real git in `tests/test_attest.py` — a normal
commit records `N`. **The signed half is not**, because signing a commit means
generating and holding a key, and never touching a credential is the product's
most distinctive promise. `test_a_signed_commit_records_what_git_says_verbatim`
drives a stubbed `git log` instead, which tests the part that is ours (carry it
through verbatim, gloss it, never judge it) and not git's answer.

What a run would need, on a machine whose owner already signs commits:

1. In a scratch repo with signing configured (`git config gpg.format ssh`,
   `git config user.signingkey ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`, `commit.gpgsign true`),
   make a signed commit and confirm `git log -1 --format=%G?` prints `G`.
2. `wring verify && wring deliver --send && wring attest`.
3. Confirm `attestation.json`'s `change.commit_signature` reads
   `{"status": "G", "signer": "<your key>", "means": "a good signature"}`.
4. `wring audit` — it must report that value and must **not** attempt to
   verify it, so the audit still passes on a machine holding no keyring.
5. Repeat with a commit signed by a key the machine does not trust: the status
   should be `U`, recorded and not refused. Wringer does not decide anybody
   else's trust.

**Do not add a signing key to CI to close this.** That is the exact thing
SPEC_PROVENANCE_V0 ruling 1 refused, and a test is not worth contradicting the
promise it exists to protect.

## Sequence E — `wring start` against a real agent binary

**Status: unverified. Never run by anyone.**

`wring start`'s agent step is `shutil.which` over a named table, and every
test — plus the committed recording — drives it against a **stub** executable
with the right filename. That is deliberate and stays that way: installing a
vendor agent is exactly the power SPEC_START_V0 §3c-i refuses, and putting one
in CI or in anyone's `scripts/demo.sh` path would contradict the thing being
demonstrated.

So what is proven is that detection finds a binary of that name, writes the
stanza, and never runs it. What is **not** proven is that the `command` and
`args` in `src/wringer/agents.py` are the invocation a real agent wants. Those
values are pinned in one table for exactly this reason (AGENTS.md rule 5): if
an agent's ACP entry point differs, it is a one-line diff.

What a run would need, on a machine whose owner already has an agent installed:

1. Install one of the table's agents by its own published route, and confirm
   the binary in `agents.AGENTS` is on `PATH` under that name.
2. In a scratch repo with a gate that fails, `wring start --accept-gates
   --agent <id>` with the agent's key already exported.
3. Confirm the loop reaches the agent — `worker.started` with
   `worker_kind: "acp"` in the loop ledger — and that `worker.finished`
   carries a non-empty `agent_name`. That is the handshake succeeding, which
   is the part a stub cannot show.
4. Grep the whole loop bundle for the key's value. It must not appear.
5. If the handshake fails on the pinned `args`, fix the table and say so in
   the commit — do not add a flag to work around it.

**A network clone is not on this list.** `wring start --clone` uses
`acquire.clone` unchanged, and `tests/test_start.py` exercises it over
`file://` for the reason the rest of the suite does: a test that needs someone
else's server to be up is a test that fails for reasons unrelated to this
code. The https path is `wring get`'s, and it is the same function.

## Sequence F — the agent table has not been renamed out from under us

**Status: first run 2026-08-11, and it found a defect.**

`src/wringer/agents.py` is a hand-kept vendor table: an id, a binary, a
package, a credential variable. Nothing in the suite can check it is current,
and nothing should — asking npm whether a package is deprecated is a network
call in an offline-by-construction suite, in a project whose whole claim is
that what proves anything makes no network call. So this is a dated row
instead.

What it costs to skip: on 2026-08-11 the first person ever to install one of
these agents found `@zed-industries/claude-code-acp` deprecated and renamed.
Both halves of the entry were stale together — the current package is
`@agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp` and its binary is `claude-agent-acp`,
frozen at 0.16.2 versus 0.66.0 — so a user following current npm guidance
installed the agent successfully and `agents.located()` reported "not
installed" about an agent that was installed, while `wring start` printed an
install line for a dead package. Nothing in 1210 tests could have caught it,
because until that day nobody had ever tried to install a real agent.

Per entry in `agents.AGENTS`, on a machine with a network:

- [ ] `npm view <package> deprecated` → empty. Any string here is the
      finding: read it, it names the replacement.
- [ ] `npm view <package> version` → compare with what the ecosystem is
      actually installing. A package frozen many minor versions behind its
      sibling is the same defect wearing a different hat.
- [ ] `npm view <package> bin` → the key must match the entry's `command`.
      The two are not derivable from each other and they drift as a pair.
- [ ] If anything moved: change `agents.py`, move `SPEC_ACP_V0.md`'s config
      example and `tests/test_acp.py`'s fixtures with it, leave `id` alone
      (it is the vendor-neutral handle config speaks), and **do not edit the
      filmed captures** — they record what was filmed.
- [ ] **Record it.** Add a row below.

| Entry | Package checked | Result | Date | Commit |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `claude-code` | `@zed-industries/claude-code-acp` | **Deprecated and renamed** → `@agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp`, binary `claude-agent-acp`; table corrected | 2026-08-11 | this commit |
| `gemini` | `@google/gemini-cli` | **never checked** | — | — |

## Sequence G — the container path, attacked

**Status: never run by anyone.** No container runtime exists on the
maintainer's machine, so this is structurally unrunnable there, exactly like
sequence A. Last attempted 2026-08-12: `sh scripts/sequence-g.sh` exited 2,
having recorded nothing.

`SECURITY.md` says the container path is *designed to* isolate and explicitly
declines to say it is *demonstrated to*. This sequence is what would change
that sentence.

**It is now one command**, added with the `execution:` backend
(SPEC_EXEC_V0.md §7):

```
sh scripts/sequence-g.sh [runtime] [image]
```

Two things about that script are the point of it. It drives every attack **as a
gate through the real backend**, so what gets measured is the argv Wringer
actually ships rather than a bespoke command line written for the occasion. And
it **refuses rather than skips**: with no runtime on PATH it exits 2 and records
nothing, because a checklist reporting no failures because it ran no attacks is
the advert this sequence's own last line warns about.

The seven attempts, which the script runs as optional gates so that one
succeeding does not stop the rest:

- [ ] `ls ~/.ssh` → must not reveal host keys.
- [ ] `env | grep -Ei 'aws|github|token|secret'` → must be empty beyond what
      the run explicitly declared. Note what the backend asks for here: an
      env **allowlist** by name, so a variable Wringer has never heard of is
      withheld for the same reason a named credential is. That is a fact about
      the argv; whether the runtime honours it is what this sequence measures.
- [ ] `cat /var/run/docker.sock` → must not exist. A reachable Docker socket
      is host root, and finding one makes every other line here moot.
- [ ] `git config --global --list` → must not reveal host credentials.
- [ ] Read a file outside the declared mount → must fail.
- [ ] Open an outbound connection → record whether it succeeds. The backend now
      passes `--network none` unless the repo typed `network: true`, so the
      question has sharpened from "which is it?" to "does the flag hold?"
- [ ] `ps aux` → record what of the host's process table is visible.
- [ ] **Record it**, including every attempt that SUCCEEDED. An attack that
      works is the finding; a checklist with only passes is a advert.

Classify each as `prevented`, `detected`, `mitigated` or `out_of_scope`, and
never write `prevented` where Wringer merely records evidence afterwards. The
script prints those four definitions and then stops, because classifying is the
half a script cannot do.

**Until a row appears above, nothing in this repository may say the container
path is demonstrated to isolate** — and that includes the `execution:` backend,
whose every property is a flag with a test behind it and not a measurement.
SPEC_EXEC_V0.md §7 states the split; `test_docs.py` keeps SECURITY.md's wording
honest.

## What is *not* here, and why

These are covered by automated tests and do not belong on a manual list.
They are named so nobody adds them again out of caution:

- `container images` and `ls -la /Applications/Docker.app` never appearing as
  a *command* a runbook tells you to run — `tests/test_docs.py`. Prose may
  still name them, and does: the fixes for both explain the broken form on
  purpose, and a warning that cannot spell the wrong command is not a
  warning. The guards distinguish a ```bash fence (an instruction) from an
  untagged one (a transcript of what happened).
- No script defaulting to one developer's sandbox path — `tests/test_docs.py`.
- The scratch tree a script may recursively delete always ends in a component
  the tool chose — `tests/test_scratch.py`.
- SETUP.md's step 7H and the selftest's copy of it not drifting apart —
  `tests/test_docs.py`.
- `run_id` being timezone-invariant — `tests/test_evidence.py`.
- The blank template naming what it found — `tests/test_detect.py`.
- `wring init && wring verify` exiting 0 in an empty repo, and saying the
  run proved nothing — `tests/test_init.py`.
- Step 7H's hygiene, and doctor's three skips outside a repo —
  `scripts/setup-selftest.sh`.

The dividing line is simple: if a check can run without a container runtime
and without a specific broken machine, it is a test, not a checklist item.
