"""`wring verify --prove` — prove the gates can fail (SPEC_VACUITY_V0.md).

> The agent wrote tautological tests, its gates pass, and the green tick means
> nothing — reward-hacking by another name, and the failure mode everyone in
> this field fears and nobody guards. The counter is deterministic: **if the
> gates still pass without the change, they never tested it.**

The mechanism is a scratch worktree detached at HEAD. That tree *is* the
pre-change tree — tracked edits absent, untracked files naturally missing — so
there is no reverse-patching and no cleverness. Run the same declared gates
there and compare:

| changed tree | pre-change tree | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| pass | **fail** | the gate tests this change — what proof looks like |
| pass | **pass** | the gate is *insensitive* to this change |

A lint gate passing on both is ordinary. **Every** gate passing on both is the
signal, and the verdict is `gates_vacuous`.

## The trap this module exists not to fall into

`git worktree add --detach` carries **tracked files and nothing else** — no
`.venv`, no `node_modules`, no build cache, because those are gitignored. A
gate of `pytest -q` therefore runs where the project is not installed, and
fails. The table above reads *pass on changed, fail on pre-change* and
concludes **the gate tests this change**.

That is a false `proven`, and it would fire on every run in any repo whose
dependencies are not committed, however tautological the tests — the feature
built to catch reward-hacking certifying it. Two things close it, and this
module does not work without both:

- **`run.prove_setup`**, an optional command run in the scratch worktree
  before the pre-change gates (`uv sync --frozen`, `npm ci`). Every repo
  already has it, because it is in their CI. If it fails the verdict is
  `inconclusive` — never `proven`, and never silently dropped.
- **every `sensitive` row cites the failure it rests on.**
  `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'yourproject'` is then instantly
  legible as a broken environment rather than as a caught regression. The
  failure is deliberately NOT auto-classified: a verdict that shows its
  working is the product, and one that hides it is the thing this spec exists
  to prevent.
