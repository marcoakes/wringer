"""The repair loop — verify, brief the worker, verify again (SPEC_RUN_V0.md).

`wring verify` proves a change. This closes the loop around it: while the
gates fail, write what failed into a brief and hand it to the worker the repo
declared, then verify again. The worker is somebody else's program — usually
a coding agent — spawned as a subprocess. **Wringer makes no LLM call and no
network call of its own here**, exactly as in v0.1.

Two rulings shape everything below:

- **A worker's exit code never ends the loop.** The evidence decides. A
  worker that crashed after fixing the bug converges on the next lap; one
  that exited cleanly without touching anything stops on `no_progress`.
- **The loop never writes to git.** It runs gates and a worker. Committing
  what came out is the human's decision.
