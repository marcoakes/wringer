"""`wring attest` and `wring audit` — SPEC_PROVENANCE_V0.md.

> "Who wrote this code, under whose authority, verified how?" — answered by a
> file, checkable offline, by someone who trusts none of us.

`attest` assembles the claim; `audit` checks it. **Neither calls an LLM and
neither touches a network, ever.** These commands *prove* things, so they live
on the never-reaches-a-network side of the line the README draws. There is no
`--send` here and never will be — a test greps this file for the modules that
could open a socket.

The claim, stated whole:

> Change **C** was **authorized** by spec **S**, **proven** by gates **G**
> with recorded results against tree **T**, **judged** against rubric **R**
> with verdict **V**, and **delivered** as branch **B** — and every bundle
> backing those clauses is byte-identical to when it was written.

And what it does NOT claim is in the artifact itself, not only in the docs.
See `LIMITS`: an attestation that reads as stronger than it is would be the
vacuity failure in a new costume, and this project has already ruled once that
a passing artifact must narrate its own emptiness.

Nothing here is signed. That is a decision (SPEC_PROVENANCE_V0 §5 ruling 1),
not an omission: signing in v0 would force a key into CI, and never touching a
credential is the product's most distinctive promise. `attestation.json.sig`
is a SIBLING file so that adding one later is purely additive — every v0
attestation stays valid byte-for-byte, and `audit` ignores a `.sig` it finds
rather than choking on it.
