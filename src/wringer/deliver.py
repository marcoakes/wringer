"""Turn a verified change into a branch and an MR — `wringer.delivery.v1`.

**The only module in Wringer that writes git history**, and the only reason
handover law 6 needed amending. The amendment is worth exactly its five
conditions, and each is a refusal here rather than a line in a document:

1. **Only a branch Wringer created.** `Bundle.event("branch.planned")` is
   appended *before* the branch exists, so "did Wringer make this?" is a
   question the ledger answers. An existing branch is a refusal.
2. **Never the default branch.** Resolved from the remote, and an
   unresolvable default is itself a refusal — a branch you could not name is
   not one you can be sure you avoided.
3. **No force push, anywhere.** `--force`, `--force-with-lease` and `+refs/`
   appear nowhere in this program, and a test greps for them.
4. **Dry run is the default.** Everything below `plan()` is written to disk
   and printed; `send()` is the same path continuing one step further.
5. **A ledger event before every git write**, so a crash mid-delivery still
   says what was attempted. Nothing is rolled back: a half-delivered branch
   is a fact, and a tidy-up that deleted branches would be a worse power than
   the one being granted.
