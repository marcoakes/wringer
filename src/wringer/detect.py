"""What `wring init` writes, and how it guesses.

The spec's ruling is the design: *if detection is uncertain, generate
comments rather than being clever*. So detection here is deliberately
literal. It reports commands the repository has already written down —
a `pyproject.toml` that configures ruff, a `package.json` with a `test`
script, a `Makefile` with a `lint` target — and never invents one. When it
finds nothing it says so and hands over a commented template, because a
wrong gate is worse than an absent one: it would make `wring verify` prove
something nobody asked for.
