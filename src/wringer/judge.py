"""The rubric judge — `wringer.judge.v1` (docs/specs/SPEC_JUDGE_V0.md).

Reads a *finished* evidence bundle plus a rubric and produces a structured
verdict. It is a standalone command over a completed artifact, the way
`wring verify` shipped before `wring run`.

That shape is what makes worker/judge isolation **physical**: this module
reads `.wringer/runs/<id>/`, while everything a worker ever said lives in
`.wringer/loops/<id>/iterations/`. The two trees do not overlap, so a
worker's reasoning cannot reach a judge — there is no code path along which
it could travel. `Packet` below is the type-level expression of that: a
frozen dataclass with a fixed field set, and no field that could carry a
loop, a brief, or a worker log.

**Dry run is the default.** `request.json` is written before the transport
is ever consulted, so what leaves the machine is auditable rather than
asserted, and `--send` is the same code path continuing one step further.
`send()` below is one of the two functions in Wringer that open a
socket; `forge.request` is the other (docs/specs/SPEC_GET_V0.md §7).
