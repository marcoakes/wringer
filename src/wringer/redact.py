"""Keep secrets out of the evidence.

A bundle captures whatever a gate printed, so a tool that echoes
`$GITHUB_TOKEN` on failure would otherwise write a live credential to disk —
and `.wringer/` is one `git add -f` away from being public.

Redaction happens **before** the write, never as a cleanup pass: the raw
value must not reach the file at all (docs/specs/SPEC_VERIFY_V0.md §Config design,
rule 5). That is why gate output is captured through a pipe rather than
handed straight to a file descriptor.

What counts as a secret: the *value* of any environment variable whose
*name* matches a redaction pattern. Defaults are `*TOKEN*`, `*SECRET*` and
`*KEY*`; a repo's `.wringer.yaml` can add more, but cannot remove the defaults —
losing token protection should never be one line of config away.
