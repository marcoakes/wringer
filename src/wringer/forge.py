"""The issue tracker and MR host — `wring issue`, and delivery's last step.

**Every vendor string in Wringer lives in this file** (AGENTS.md rule 5).
`cli.py` says "the forge"; only `_MAPPINGS` below knows that GitHub calls a
merge request a pull request, that GitLab numbers issues `iid`, or which
header carries the token. Adding a forge is adding a row.

`request()` is **the second and last function in Wringer that opens a
socket** — `judge.send` is the other. Until this slice that sentence said
"only", and SPEC_GET_V0.md §7 restates it rather than quietly keeping the old
claim. It used to name a grep that would prove it; the grep counted this
docstring, so `tests/test_network_surface.py` parses the modules instead.

Both sockets obey the same rules: reached only with a flag a human typed,
only against an endpoint the repo declared, only after the bytes are on
disk, and never following a redirect — a redirect could move a patch to a
host the repo never wrote down.
