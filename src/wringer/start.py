"""`wring start` — the guided launch (docs/specs/SPEC_START_V0.md).

The program's first interactive surface, and the machinery that makes it
testable: everything here is a pure function of the answers it was given, so
the whole wizard runs with no terminal at all. `cli.py` owns the prompting,
the printing and the exit codes, exactly as it does for every other command.

**There is no config WRITER anywhere else in the program** — `config.py`
parses and never emits, and `wring init` writes a template rather than a
config it composed. So `emit` below is new machinery, and it carries the two
rulings that make writing a config safe (§3d):

1. **An existing `.wringer.yaml` is read, never replaced.** Additions are
   appended as text, so every byte the user wrote — comments included —
   survives verbatim. A load-and-dump round trip would silently delete the
   commented template `wring init` ships, which is most of what a new user
   has to read.
2. **Every emitted config round-trips through `config.parse` before it is
   written.** A wizard that writes a config the parser rejects is a wizard
   that bricks the repo it was pointed at, and it would do it to the least
   technical user this program has.
