    **The record wins.** `started_at` carries a UTC offset, so it is
    unambiguous, and a directory NAME is not: ids were stamped in local time
    until 2026-08-05, and a container writing UTC against a host writing BST
    produced ids that sorted forty minutes from the truth. Ids are UTC now;
    reading the record rather than the name is what stops the next timezone
    mattering at all.

    **Every fallback is read as UTC too**, because that is what an id means
    in this version. Getting this wrong is not theoretical — the first
    attempt at this function kept the old local-time parse for directories
    with no record, on the reasoning that it preserved existing behaviour,
    and that quietly misdated by the host's offset the two cases that reach
    it most:

      - a loop KILLED mid-flight, which is the only thing `wring resume`
        exists for, and which never reached `loop.write_manifest`;
      - every `wring judge` verdict, which writes `verdict.json` and not a
        manifest — so `wring deliver` picking "the latest verdict" took the
        fallback 100% of the time.

    A directory whose name is not a run id at all is dated by mtime: `--output`
    lets a caller name a directory anything and QUICKSTART teaches exactly
    that, so compared as *text* one letter outranks every real run forever —
    `manual-001` beats `20260730-…` because "m" > "2", and `wring explain`
    would keep diagnosing the manual run however many newer ones landed.

    Within one second an id ends in a *random* suffix, not a counter, so
    mtime breaks that tie too. Two runs landing in the same second is not a

    ONE implementation, called by both the writer (`Bundle.write_untracked`)
    and the reader (`wring deliver`'s check). Two implementations of the same
    hash is a bug waiting for a platform difference to expose it — and a
    disagreement here reads as tampering, which is the worst possible false
    alarm for a tool whose product is trust.

    **What is hashed is what git would COMMIT, not what a gate could read.**
    v1 of this file did `target.open("rb")`, which follows symlinks, so it
    recorded the referent's bytes — and git records mode `120000` and a blob
    holding the LINK TEXT. Those are different objects, and pinning one does
    not pin the other. Measured against `git cat-file` rather than reasoned
    about; `tests/test_untracked.py` keeps them agreeing.

    That one confusion was wrong in both directions at once. Too loose:
    retarget a link at a file with identical bytes, or `chmod +x` a script,
    and delivery saw nothing to refuse even though the committed tree had
    changed. Too strict: a dangling link, and a link to a directory, both
    raised `OSError` and recorded `UNREADABLE`, which `wring deliver` refuses
    on — and re-running `wring verify` recorded `UNREADABLE` again, so the
    refusal was permanent and nothing the user could do cleared it. Worse
    still, a link to a FIFO *blocked forever*: `wring verify` never returned.
    `os.readlink` never touches what the link points at, so all five go away
    together.

    Mode and digest live in one string. That keeps the schema's
    `additionalProperties` a simple pattern, and it makes a type flip a
    digest change by construction rather than by a future reader remembering
    to compare two keys.

    `UNREADABLE` survives and now means what it says: a real `OSError` on a
    real file, which after this change is essentially a permissions problem.
    A path that is neither a regular file nor a symlink records `UNSUPPORTED`
    — git will not commit it either, so claiming a digest for it would be
    inventing one.

    defect rather than a preference.

    `started_at` in the manifest stays local-with-offset. That is the field a
    human reads, and the offset is the part they want.

    Callers pass an aware datetime, so this is a conversion and not a
    reinterpretation.

    The random suffix — not a counter — keeps two runs in the same second
    from colliding without either one having to read the other's state.
