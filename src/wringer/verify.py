"""Run a verification and write its bundle — the core `wring verify` drives.

Split out of `cli.py` so something other than the console can ask for a
verification and get the answer as data: `wring run` needs a full verify per
iteration (SPEC_RUN_V0.md), and shelling out to itself to get one would mean
parsing its own output.

The split is deliberately narrow. This module owns the part that is the same
however it was invoked — snapshot git, open a bundle, run the planned gates
in order, stop on the first required failure, write the manifest and the
summary. `cli.py` keeps everything that is about being a command line:
argument parsing, precondition messages, exit codes, and printing.
