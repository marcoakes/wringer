# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI agents (and humans) working in this repository. Wringer
dogfoods its own principle: *the repo is the agent-experience surface.*

Read this file, then [SPEC_VERIFY_V0.md](SPEC_VERIFY_V0.md) end to
end. The spec is the binding contract for everything in `src/wringer/`.

## What this repo is

Wringer (`wring`) is an open-source, control-plane-agnostic AI-DLC harness:
it compiles intent (issues, PRDs, Slack messages) into verified outcomes
(reviewed MRs with evidence), using graphs of loop-bearing agents,
portable across local, Temporal, AWS AgentCore, Google Agent Engine,
Microsoft Foundry, and Anthropic Managed Agents runtimes.

**v0.1.0 ships one slice of that: `wring verify`, a standalone evidence
compiler.** One command that runs a repo's declared gates and leaves
behind an evidence bundle a human or an agent can inspect. No LLM calls,
no network, no uploads — ever.

### Document hierarchy

| Document | Authority |
|---|---|
| [SPEC_VERIFY_V0.md](SPEC_VERIFY_V0.md) | **binding** for v0.1 implementation — CLI surface, exit codes, bundle format, build order, release bar |
| [SPEC_RUN_V0.md](SPEC_RUN_V0.md) | **binding** for v0.2 slice 1 — `wring run`, the `run:` config section, the loop's rulings and `wringer.loop.v1` |
| [SPEC_INTENT_V0.md](SPEC_INTENT_V0.md) | **binding** for `wring spec` / `wring plan` — `wringer.spec.v1`, the approval interlock, and why there is no `--yes`. The captured loop is [docs/pm-loop.md](docs/pm-loop.md) |
| [SPEC_GET_V0.md](SPEC_GET_V0.md) | **binding** for `wring get` / `wring issue` / `wring deliver` — and for the amended law 6: the five conditions that buy the power to write git history |
| [SPEC_ACP_V0.md](SPEC_ACP_V0.md) | **binding** for the `acp:` worker form — Wringer is the ACP *client* and never the agent, and it neither bundles nor installs one |
| [SPEC_JUDGE_V0.md](SPEC_JUDGE_V0.md) | **binding** for `wring judge` — the closed-list packet, the rubric, exit 5, and why a dry run is the default |
| [SPEC_SUPERVISION_V0.md](SPEC_SUPERVISION_V0.md) | **binding** for `wring fleet` and the supervision invariants — every budget nests, every child is reapable |
| [SPEC_VACUITY_V0.md](SPEC_VACUITY_V0.md) | **binding** for `wring verify --prove` and `run.prove` — a green tick that could not have been red is worth nothing |
| [SPEC_PROVENANCE_V0.md](SPEC_PROVENANCE_V0.md) | **binding** for `wring attest` / `wring audit` — what an unsigned attestation does and does not claim |
| [SPEC_START_V0.md](SPEC_START_V0.md) | **binding** for `wring start` — the guided launch: the credential ruling, the non-interactive contract, and why a clone stops before any gate runs |
| [SPEC_GRAPH_V0.md](SPEC_GRAPH_V0.md) | **binding** for `wring graph` — graphs name capabilities never commands, state routes while only bundles gate, a parked graph is exit 5, and `--send` is typed on the invocation and carried by no file. The captured park→resume is [docs/graphs.md](docs/graphs.md) |
| [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) | execution order (90-day compression) |
| [wringer-ai-dlc-harness-plan.md](wringer-ai-dlc-harness-plan.md) | architectural north star (post-v0.1) |
| README · [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) | landing pages — transcripts are now **real captured output**; if you change console or bundle shape, recapture them rather than editing the numbers by hand |
| [examples/claude-code-hook/](examples/claude-code-hook/) | the agent loop as a Claude Code `PostToolUse` hook — an *example*, not part of the package; it ships no code into `src/` and adds no dependency |
| [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) | the execution model (`.wringer.yaml` is code), what a bundle may contain, reporting channel |

Where they disagree about v0.1, the spec wins.

## Current state — v0.1.0 shipped; 0.2 in progress on `main`

**`v0.1.0` is tagged and on PyPI** (`pip install wringer`). `wring init`,
`wring verify` and `wring explain` are that release: `verify` runs a repo's
whole declared gate set and writes a real bundle, `--json` feeds agents, and
secrets never reach the disk.

On `main` since, unreleased as 0.2: `wring run` closes the loop, `wring
resume` continues a killed one, `wring fleet` supervises hundreds, `wring
judge` weighs a finished bundle against a rubric, `wring doctor` checks this
machine's preconditions, the `acp:` worker form talks to any agent that speaks
the protocol, and `wring spec` / `wring plan` are the front door — a PRD in,
a spec a human approves, work a fleet can run; P3 brings work in as a URL and
sends it back out as a reviewed branch; P5 turns a finished run into an
attestation `wring audit` checks offline; and P4's `wring start` is the guided
launch a new user meets first. 830+ tests on Python 3.11–3.13 plus macOS in CI.

**Wringer verifies Wringer**: [`.wringer.yaml`](.wringer.yaml) declares this
repo's own gates, CI runs `wring verify` and uploads the bundle, and a real
one is committed at [`.wringer.example/`](.wringer.example/).

| Bolt | Spec day | State |
|---|---|---|
| 1 — skeleton | Day 1 | ✅ packaging, config loader, `wring init`, `wring verify` running one gate, `evidence.jsonl` + `manifest.json`, exit codes 0/1/2 |
| 2 — gate runner | Day 2 | ✅ every gate in declared order, `timeout` enforced (process-group kill), stop-on-first-required-failure, optional-gate semantics, per-gate `gates/NNN_id/{stdout.log,stderr.log,result.json}`, `summary.md`, CI |
| 2.5 — review hardening | — | ✅ gate ids validated as slugs, internal git calls bounded, POSIX-only kill declared, ruff lint gate + macOS CI, real transcripts, SECURITY.md |
| 3 — git evidence | Day 3 | ✅ changed/untracked lists, `diff.patch`, `status.txt`, `git.status` event, timestamps on every event, `wring verify --json`, `wring explain` |
| 4 — redaction & safety | Day 4 | ✅ env redaction before write, capped logs with a declared note, binary + textconv exclusion, exit 2 outside a repo, exit 3 mid-merge/rebase, exit 4 on SIGINT with the gate killed |
| 5 — dogfood | Day 5 | ✅ `wring init` detects real commands (pyproject / package.json / Makefile) and gitignores `.wringer/`, `wring verify --output`, Wringer's own `.wringer.yaml`, CI runs `wring verify` + uploads the bundle, committed bundle in `.wringer.example/` |
| v0.2 slice 1 — the loop | — | ✅ `wring run`: `run:` config, verify→brief→worker→verify, plateau fingerprint, `wringer.loop.v1` bundle, loop schemas ([SPEC_RUN_V0.md](SPEC_RUN_V0.md)) |
| 5.5 — pre-publish hardening | — | ✅ interrupted runs named in `summary.md` and diagnosed by `explain`, `latest_run` ordered by time not name, reused `--output` cleared before writing, post-kill drain bounded, event lists scrubbed, `evidence.include` shape-checked |
| P3 — repos in, changes out | — | ✅ `wring get` · `wring issue` · `wring deliver`: the amended law 6 and its five refusals, `wringer.delivery.v1` and `wringer.acquired.v1` ([SPEC_GET_V0.md](SPEC_GET_V0.md)) |
| P4 — the guided launch | — | ✅ `wring start`: preflight, the first config WRITER in the program, agent detection that never installs, the credential ruling, the clone that stops before any gate, and a launch that refuses to call a placeholder gate a pass ([SPEC_START_V0.md](SPEC_START_V0.md)) |
| P2 — the front door | — | ✅ `wring spec` / `wring plan`: `wringer.spec.v1`, the approval interlock, questions instead of guesses, gates proposed as a diff, `human: true` criteria a judge is never asked ([SPEC_INTENT_V0.md](SPEC_INTENT_V0.md), [docs/pm-loop.md](docs/pm-loop.md)) |

The `v0.1.0` tag is gated on the spec's
[Definition of PROVEN](SPEC_VERIFY_V0.md#definition-of-proven--the-repo-must-show-its-own-receipts),
not on the code compiling.

## Build, test, run

Python **3.11+**. Dependencies: PyYAML at runtime, pytest for dev —
nothing else without asking.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv                          # any Python 3.11+
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -e '.[dev]'
```

With [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) instead (what the maintainer's Mac
uses — its `.venv` is uv-made and has **no pip**, so use `uv pip`):

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
uv venv --python 3.12
uv pip install -e '.[dev]' --python .venv/bin/python
```

Then:

```bash
.venv/bin/pytest                # the gate: all tests, ~10s, must be green
.venv/bin/wring --help
.venv/bin/wring start             # the guided launch: preflight, config, first build
.venv/bin/wring init              # writes .wringer.yaml (refuses to overwrite)
.venv/bin/wring verify            # runs every gate, writes .wringer/runs/<run_id>/
.venv/bin/wring verify --gate ID  # one gate, numbered as if the full run happened
.venv/bin/wring verify --json     # one object on stdout, no human report
.venv/bin/wring explain           # diagnose the latest run (no LLM)
.venv/bin/wring spec PRD.md       # draft wringer.spec.yaml (dry run: sends nothing)
.venv/bin/wring plan              # an approved spec -> tasks.jsonl, briefs, rubric
.venv/bin/wring get URL           # clone into the declared workspace
.venv/bin/wring issue 42          # write a forge issue to a markdown file
.venv/bin/wring deliver           # dry run: patch, message, branch, MR body
```

**`wring verify` on this repo is the law** — it runs the two gates
[`.wringer.yaml`](.wringer.yaml) declares, which are exactly:

```bash
.venv/bin/ruff check src tests examples   # must be clean
.venv/bin/pytest                 # must be green
```

Run them however you like, but `wring verify` is what CI runs and what the
committed bundle proves. Gates inherit your `PATH`, so the venv has to be on
it (`export PATH="$PWD/.venv/bin:$PATH"`) or `ruff` will not be found — the
same rule as any `Makefile`.

CI mirrors exactly this:
[`.github/workflows/tests.yml`](.github/workflows/tests.yml) runs ruff
once and pytest on 3.11 / 3.12 / 3.13 plus macOS, for every push and PR.
Bolt 5 upgrades that workflow to run `wring verify` and upload the bundle —
and these two commands are the gates Wringer's own `.wringer.yaml` will
declare. Ruff config lives in `pyproject.toml` (`E,F,W,I,UP,B`,
line-length 88); there is still no `Makefile`, and any further dependency
is a decision to ask about.

Gate output is **captured, never teed**: streams go to the bundle's log
files, and only a failing required gate gets a 20-line tail on the
console. If you are tempted to add `--verbose`, read the spec's demo
block first — the clean console is the product.

## Module map (`src/wringer/`)

| Module | Does | Deliberately does not (yet) |
|---|---|---|
| `cli.py` | argparse surface, subcommands, exit codes, the console report, `--json`, `--output`, and `wring explain`'s rendering | register `--changed-only` — see below |
| `config.py` | strict `.wringer.yaml` loader → frozen `Config`/`Gate` dataclasses; validates `evidence.redact` because a typo there must not silently disable redaction | consume `evidence.include` (still shape-only) |
| `detect.py` | find the commands a repo already declares — ruff/mypy/pytest in `pyproject.toml`, npm scripts, Makefile targets — and render `.wringer.yaml`; fall back to a commented template when nothing is found | invent a command nobody wrote down (*"if detection is uncertain, generate comments rather than being clever"*) |
| `git.py` | root detection, HEAD SHA, branch, dirty flag, changed/untracked lists, `diff`/`status` capture, and the refusal checks (`is_repo`, `in_progress`); read-only, bounded, never fatal | write anything — every call here is a read |
| `gates.py` | run one gate through the shell in the repo root: own process group, `timeout` enforced by SIGTERM→SIGKILL on the group, output captured **through a pipe** so it can be scrubbed and capped before it is written, duration in ms | decide anything about *which* gates run — that is `cli.py`'s sequencing |
| `evidence.py` | allocate `.wringer/runs/<run_id>/`, append timestamped `evidence.jsonl`, write `manifest.json`, `gates/NNN_id/` + `result.json`, capture files, and read a finished bundle back (`latest_run`, `read_*`) — scrubbing every write, because the `Bundle` holds the redactor | decide *what* counts as a secret — that is `redact.py` |
| `redact.py` | turn env-var name patterns into the set of secret values, and erase them from text or bytes | look anywhere but the environment |
| `summary.py` | render `summary.md`: repo line, gate table with statuses and log links, the exact rerun command | anything an agent parses — machines read `evidence.jsonl` / `manifest.json` |
| `verify.py` | one verification as a **callable**: snapshot git, open a bundle, run the planned gates, stop on the first required failure, write manifest + summary, return an `Outcome`. Also `plan()` and the `--json` shape both commands share | print anything, or decide an exit code — that is `cli.py`'s |
| `judge.py` | `wring judge`: the closed-list `Packet`, the request, the verdict, and `send()` — **one of the two** functions in the program that opens a socket (`forge.request` is the other; it was "the only" until P3, and SPEC_GET_V0.md §7 restates it rather than quietly keeping the claim) | see a worker's output; there is no field in `Packet` that could carry one |
| `forge.py` | the issue tracker and MR host: **every vendor string in Wringer**, behind one mapping table, plus `request()` — the second and last socket | appear in `cli.py`; the CLI says "the forge" and never "GitHub" |
| `acquire.py` | `wring get` and the record of where a working copy came from (`wringer.acquired.v1`); the URL and scheme refusals | run anything it cloned — a fresh clone is untrusted input, and `.wringer.yaml` is code |
| `deliver.py` | `wring deliver`: **the only module that writes git history**, and the five refusals that buy that power (SPEC_GET_V0.md §1) | force-push, delete a branch, rewrite history, touch the default branch, or roll back a half-delivered one |
| `rubric.py` | `wringer.rubric.v1` — its own file because its bytes travel, so it gets its own size and shape limits | live under `.wringer/` (a rubric is source, not evidence) |
| `fleet.py` | `wring fleet`: a bounded pool of child `wring run` subprocesses, the self-healing ladder, reaping by ledger growth, honest partial-success counts | do the work itself — it is only a supervisor |
| `loop.py` | v0.2's `wring run`: verify → brief → worker → verify, the plateau fingerprint, and the `wringer.loop.v1` bundle under `.wringer/loops/` | call an LLM, touch git, or nest a verify bundle inside a loop bundle (runs are referenced by path) |
| `acp.py` | the Agent Client Protocol client: spawn the agent, JSON-RPC over stdio, one session per iteration, kill on timeout through the same process-group machinery. Wringer is the ACP *client*, never the agent (SPEC_ACP_V0.md) | bundle, install or recommend an agent |
| `graph.py` | `wring graph`: the graph document — schema, strict validation (DAG, reachability, dataflow), the three router forms parsed by grammar, the Mermaid renderer — and the executor, which **wraps** `loop.run` and `deliver.plan`/`send` in process and adds sequencing and stopping. A graph names capabilities; there is no `command:` key and a key that looks like one is a hard error (SPEC_GRAPH_V0 ruling 1) | evaluate an expression (there is no `eval` and never will be), reimplement a loop or a delivery, gate on state rather than a bundle (ruling 2), or take `--send` from any file (ruling 5) |
| `doctor.py` | `wring doctor`: machine-checkable preconditions, one line per check, `--json`, exit 1 on anything blocking | repair anything — it diagnoses and stops |
| `spec.py` | `wring spec` / `wring plan`: `wringer.spec.v1`, the drafting request, the strict reply parser, the file renderer, and what `wring plan` compiles out of an approved spec — `tasks.jsonl`, the briefs, `wringer.rubric.yaml`, and the proposed gate diff | open a socket (it calls `judge.send`), install a gate, touch git, run anything, or read `approved` from a reply |
| `vacuity.py` | `wring verify --prove` / `run.prove`: re-run the gates against the pre-change tree in a scratch worktree, and record the verdict — a gate that passes on both proved nothing about the change | decide what the caller does about a vacuous verdict; `attest` refuses over one |
| `attest.py` | `wring attest` / `wring audit`: assemble the provenance claim from bundles that re-verify against their own digests and ledger chains, and check one offline — no config, no network, no LLM | sign anything, or let a passing audit read as a stronger claim than "unaltered since written" |
| `start.py` | `wring start`: **the only config WRITER in the program** — an existing `.wringer.yaml` is read and appended to, never replaced, and every emission round-trips through `config.parse` before it can be written. Also the prompt seam and the console width the demo canvas needs | store a credential, write a shell worker, keep state of its own in `.wringer.yaml`, or run a gate in a repo it just cloned |
| `agents.py` | the ACP agent table: **every coding-agent vendor string in Wringer**, behind one mapping — id, binary, args, the variable its credential lives in, its install command | run anything; it imports nothing that could start a process, so the install command it holds cannot be executed |

Every module in the spec's layout now exists.

### `wring spec` — the three rules that are not negotiable

1. **`approved: false` is written as a constant**, not derived from anything.
   No flag, environment variable or model reply may set it; a reply carrying
   an `approved` key is refused outright rather than quietly ignored, and
   `wring plan` re-reads the file from disk every time. There is deliberately
   **no `--yes`**: it is the slice.
2. **`intent` is quoted from the PRD by Wringer**, never taken from the reply.
   A model paraphrasing the human's own words inside the artifact the human is
   about to approve is the failure this slice exists to prevent.
3. **Everything proposed goes through the real parser** — criteria through
   `rubric.parse_document`, gates through `config.parse_gate` — so Wringer
   cannot propose a rubric the judge would reject or a gate `.wringer.yaml`
   would refuse. That is also what makes "the criteria block is a
   `wringer.rubric.v1` document by construction" true rather than hoped for.

And two safety rules that come from writing files a model named: every
spec-declared path is refused if it could leave the repo (as a string *and*
after resolving, which is what catches a symlink), and `wring plan` refuses to
overwrite anything it did not itself generate — briefs carry a marker,
`tasks.jsonl` is checked with `fleet.load_tasks`.

### Do not add these early

v0.1's [Non-goals](SPEC_VERIFY_V0.md#non-goals-for-v010-binding) still bind
everything under `wring verify`. `wring run` now exists, but only the slice
[SPEC_RUN_V0.md](SPEC_RUN_V0.md) defines: still **no issue ingestion, no PR
creation, no commits or pushes, no Temporal, no OpenTelemetry, no multi-agent
anything**, and no anti-thrash beyond the plateau fingerprint.

**Four commands SEND and three FETCH, and only those seven.** SEND:
`wring judge --send`, `wring spec --send`, `wring deliver --send`, and
`wring graph run --send` (or `wring graph resume --send`), which reaches a
network only by calling the same `deliver.send` — a `git push` in a
subprocess, through delivery's five refusals, with no socket and no merge
request of its own (SPEC_GRAPH_V0 §5.5: the flag is typed on the invocation,
authorises the deliver node that invocation reaches once, and no file may
carry it). Each requires a section the repo wrote down — `judge:`, `forge:`
or `deliver:` — each writes
the exact bytes to disk before any socket opens, and each is dry-run or
explicit by default. FETCH, not behind a flag because fetching is the entire
purpose: `wring get` clones a repository, `wring issue` reads one issue, and
**`wring start --clone`** clones one — the third fetcher, added in P4, and the
only one of the six that a new user meets first. It opens a socket under
exactly one condition: the user asked it to clone. It then **stops**, because
a fresh clone is untrusted input and running its gates in the same invocation
would be the most dangerous command in the program aimed at the least
technical user it has (SPEC_START_V0.md §3e).

**Every socket lives in `judge.send` or `forge.request`**, so `grep -rn
build_opener src/` has exactly two answers and must keep having exactly two —
a clone is `git` in a subprocess, not a socket this program opens. Everything
that *proves* anything still makes no LLM call and no network call: the worker
is the user's own program, and every worker in the test suite is a shell
one-liner or the repo's own fake ACP agent.

**Wringer never stores a credential.** `wring start` will ask for your API key
so it can hand it to the build it launches; it keeps it in memory for that
session, folds it into the redactor so it cannot reach a bundle, and writes it
nowhere. Your config records the *name* of an environment variable, never a
key. Nothing else in Wringer ever asks.

**Wringer writes git history in exactly one place.** `deliver.py`, only on
`--send`, only onto a branch it created, never the default branch, never a
force push, with a ledger event appended before each write. That is handover
law 6 as Marc amended it on 2026-08-01; SPEC_GET_V0.md §1 is the contract and
every one of its five conditions has a test that fails without it. Since P7
there are **two ways to reach that one place** — `wring deliver --send` and a
graph's `deliver` node under `wring graph run --send` — and the module, the
refusals and the typed flag are the same ones in both. `wring
run`, `wring verify`, `wring spec` and `wring plan` still touch git not at
all, and the fleet's `worktree add/remove` is still metadata.

`wring spec` and `wring plan` add their own non-goals, binding
([SPEC_INTENT_V0.md](SPEC_INTENT_V0.md) §5): no multi-turn refinement (edit
the file), no auto-applying gate changes, **no auto-approval in any form**, no
effort or cost estimation, no design output, no issue-tracker ingestion, and
neither command runs a gate or touches git.

Also: a flag that half-works is worse than a missing flag, because agents
consume this CLI. `--changed-only` stays **unregistered**.
`--changed-only` is deliberately deferred: the spec names it but never
defines it, and the plausible readings (skip a clean tree · scope gates to
changed files · limit what is captured) are different products. Pin the
semantics in the spec before building it.

## Contracts you must not break

**Exit codes** (the spec's table — all five are live now):

| code | meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | all required gates passed |
| 1 | a required gate failed |
| 2 | config or environment error |
| 3 | unsafe dirty state / refused precondition |
| 4 | interrupted |
| 5 | `wring judge` only: needs a human — nothing competent scored the evidence |

**The evidence bundle is the product** — boring, stable, grep-friendly,
and the interface future judges and agents consume ([RFC #2](https://github.com/marcoakes/wringer/issues/2)).
`manifest.json` carries `"schema_version": "wringer.evidence.v1"`;
`evidence.jsonl` is append-only, one JSON object per line, `type` first.
Changing either shape is a spec change, not an implementation detail —
bump the schema version and say so in the commit.

That shape is now **published as JSON Schema** in [`schema/`](schema/), and
[tests/test_schema.py](tests/test_schema.py) fails if the code writes a key
the schema does not declare. Adding a field therefore means editing the
schema in the same commit — which is the point: the version string is what a
new field costs.

Three conventions inside the bundle are load-bearing:

- **`gates/NNN_<id>/` numbering follows the *declared* order, not the run.**
  `wring verify --gate test` on a three-gate config still writes
  `gates/003_test/`, so a directory name means the same thing in a full
  run, a partial run and a single-gate run.
- **Every event carries `ts`** (local ISO-8601, milliseconds). The spec's
  example was amended in Bolt 3 to match; keep them in step.
- **`git.status` carries `untracked` only when there is something
  untracked**, so the common case stays exactly the spec's shape.
- **The git capture happens before the bundle directory exists**, or
  Wringer's own `.wringer/` would show up as an untracked file in its own
  evidence. Order matters in `cmd_verify`; do not reshuffle it.
- **A `log` field appears on `gate.finished` for failing gates only** —
  it is a pointer to where the reader is being sent, not an inventory
  (every gate's logs are on disk and linked from `summary.md`).
- **Skipped gates leave no trace in `evidence.jsonl` and no directory.**
  They were not run, so claiming otherwise would be a lie; `summary.md`
  is the one place the full declared set appears, marked `skipped` — or
  `interrupted` for the one gate a Ctrl-C caught mid-flight, which is
  neither passed nor skipped and still gets no invented `gate.finished`.
- **One directory describes one run.** `--output` reuses the directory it
  is given, so `Bundle.at` first clears the previous bundle (`evidence.jsonl`,
  `manifest.json`, `summary.md`, `diff.patch`, `status.txt`, `gates/`) and
  nothing else — the directory is the caller's. Leaving a stale
  `gates/NNN_id/result.json` behind is how a bundle comes to say a gate
  passed on the same screen its summary calls it skipped.
- **`latest_run` orders by time, never by name.** A `--output` directory can
  be called anything, and as text `manual-001` outranks every real run id
  forever. Ids are dated from their timestamp prefix, other names from their
  mtime.

**Gate ids are slugs** (`[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9_-]*`, ≤64 chars) because
they become directory names: `gates/NNN_<id>/`. A config saying
`id: ../../x` is a parse error, not a path traversal. Widening that
pattern means re-checking every place an id reaches the filesystem.

**v0.1 supports macOS and Linux.** Timeout enforcement needs process
groups (`os.killpg`), which is POSIX-only; `gates.py` degrades to killing
just the shell elsewhere and pyproject's classifiers say so. Windows is a
v0.2 conversation, not a silent failure.

**Redaction happens before the write, never after.** The `Bundle` owns a
`Redactor` so every write path scrubs by construction; gate output travels
through a pipe for the same reason. If you add a file to the bundle, add it
through the `Bundle`, or you have quietly opted out of the one guarantee
SECURITY.md makes. Scrub first, *then* truncate — truncation must never be
what saves a secret.

**Config semantics:** validation is strict — unknown keys are errors,
because a typo in a gate definition must not silently change what
"verified" means. `optional` is the canonical field; `required` is
accepted as its negation (the spec spells it both ways); both together
is an error.

**Bundle location:** `.wringer/` is gitignored — real runs stay local
(nothing uploads, ever). The one committed bundle lives in
`.wringer.example/runs/…` and is sanitized by hand.

## Operating rules

1. **AI-DLC discipline.** One bolt at a time: short plan → maintainer's
   approval → execute → verify → commit → report → pause. Do not start
   the next bolt on your own initiative.
2. **Never claim a bolt done unless its checks actually ran.** Paste the
   real command output — `pytest` summary and a `wring` transcript — into
   the report. Fabricated or "should work" output is the one unforgivable
   sin in a repo whose entire product is evidence.
3. **Tests come with the commit that needs them**, not later. The existing
   suite is the shape to match: contract assertions (event sequence,
   manifest and `result.json` fields, exit codes, `summary.md` rows),
   scratch-repo fixtures in [tests/conftest.py](tests/conftest.py), and no
   mocking of git or subprocess — a timeout test really spawns `sleep 30`
   and really kills it.
4. **Small conventional commits** — `feat:`, `fix:`, `test:`, `docs:`,
   `chore:`. Evidence in the PR description.
5. **Vendor strings behind mapping layers.** Any external API surface,
   protocol attribute, or vendor identifier goes behind the designated
   mapping module. Pin versions.
6. **Update this file** whenever build/test/run behavior, the module map,
   or the bolt state changes. It is the first thing the next agent reads.

## Repo-specific gotchas

- **The maintainer's Mac may have no git push credential** (no `gh`, no
  SSH keys, no Homebrew). Try `git push`; if it fails, commits queue
  locally and the maintainer pushes, or publishing happens through the
  browser against his logged-in GitHub session — his call, per bolt.
  Never work around it, never handle a token — surface the block and ask.
- **`.wringer.yaml` is arbitrary code execution by design** — gates run
  through a shell with the user's privileges. Never add a feature that
  widens that (no fetching a config over the network, no running a gate
  from an untrusted source) without a spec change and a SECURITY.md
  update. Bundles are redacted before write, but redaction only knows about
  values in the environment — a secret a gate reads from a file and prints
  is still yours to catch, so read a bundle before pasting it anywhere.
- **A red CI build here CAN be read, without auth.** The logs are login-walled
  (403 on the API, a login wall on the web), which is why `tests.yml` pipes
  pytest's failures into a `::error::` annotation — and annotations are public:

  ```bash
  curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/marcoakes/wringer/commits/<sha>/check-runs"
  # then, per failing run id:
  curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/marcoakes/wringer/check-runs/<id>/annotations"
  ```

  Read that BEFORE forming a hypothesis. On 2026-08-07 a day went into guessing
  at five red builds, and two production changes were made on hypotheses that
  turned out to be wrong, while the actual failing assertions were sitting in
  that endpoint the whole time. Run status is readable the same way
  (`/actions/runs?per_page=5`), but it is **60 requests/hour per IP** — poll
  once, never in a loop.

- **`scripts/ci-repro.sh` passing is NOT CI passing.** It was green through
  five red builds and got quoted three times as evidence. It reproduces a
  fresh clone and a missing git identity; it now also pins `TMPDIR=/tmp` and
  `init.defaultBranch=master`, because both were deciding the outcome:
  a bare repo made without `-b main` breaks `git remote set-head -a` wherever
  git defaults to `master`, and every stderr message is wrapped to the
  terminal, so a shorter tmp path moves where a line breaks and a multi-word
  assertion fails. **Assert on flattened output** — `conftest.flat` — never on
  where the formatter chose to break a line.

- **Revert the fix and watch the test go red.** It costs a minute and it has
  now caught three tests in one week that passed against broken code: a
  descriptor count that moved with GC timing, a leak test that passed because
  the command REFUSED and wrote nothing, and one asserting a phrase the
  wrapper had started breaking. A test written after the fix proves nothing
  until it has failed once.

- **Don't run `wring verify` on this repo casually while iterating** — each
  run writes a new `.wringer/runs/<id>/`. Harmless (gitignored), just noisy.
- **Test repos must be isolated from the developer's git config.**
  `tests/conftest.py` pins `user.name`, `user.email` and
  `commit.gpgsign=false` for exactly this reason.
- Unicode `✓`/`✗` in console output is intentional (it is the spec's demo
  shape). Keep the report format aligned with the spec, and update the
  spec first if it must change.

## Conventions

- Python 3.11+, `src/` layout, `from __future__ import annotations`,
  frozen dataclasses for value types, argparse for the CLI, no third-party
  deps beyond PyYAML.
- Comments explain *why*, especially where a spec ruling is non-obvious;
  they do not narrate *what*.
- Apache-2.0; DCO sign-off not required at this stage.
- Docs in Markdown; diagrams as Mermaid or fenced ASCII (both render on
  GitHub).
- The TypeScript monorepo (Node 22, pnpm workspaces, package-boundary
  lint matrix) remains the plan's shape for the **later graph engine** —
  revisit at v0.2. It does not apply to v0.1's Python code.
