"""Put a coding agent's edits through the wringer, every time.

A Claude Code `PostToolUse` hook: after the agent edits a file, run the
repo's declared gates and hand the agent back the structured result and the
diagnosis. When every gate passes it says nothing.

This is the v0.1 shape of the loop `wring run` will own in v0.2 — the agent
is the worker, `wring verify` is the gate, and the evidence bundle is what
both of them argue from. Nothing here calls an LLM or uploads anything; the
hook only reads what `wring` already wrote to disk.

Control flow follows Wringer's exit codes, which are contract
(docs/specs/SPEC_VERIFY_V0.md): 0 passed - 1 a required gate failed - 2 config or
environment error - 3 refused (unsafe tree) - 4 interrupted.

Feedback follows Claude Code's hook contract: a PostToolUse hook **cannot
block** — the tool has already run — so the way to reach the model is
`hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` on stdout with exit 0, not a non-zero
exit. A non-zero exit here would only print a line at the human.

Stdlib only. Install: see README.md beside this file.
